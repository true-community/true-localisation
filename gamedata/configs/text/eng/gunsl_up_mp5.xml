  <string id="gunsl_mp5_up_torch_name">
    <text>Tactical flashlight</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_mp5_up_torch_descr">
    <text>A long-range, narrow-field flashlight to assist with nighttime exploration and eliminates the need to hold one separately. Installation does not prevent the addition of a laser sight.</text>

  <string id="gunsl_mp5_up_zatvor_balancer_name">
    <text>Balance the bolt group</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_mp5_up_zatvor_balancer_descr">
    <text>Balancing of the bolt group components reduces the barrel's departure from line of sight when firing, and also reduces perceived recoil by the shooter.</text>
