  <string id="gunsl_wpn_gauss_up_guard_name">
    <text>Snipe-Guard complex</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_wpn_gauss_up_guard_descr">
    <text>A suite of infrared sensors, integrated directly with the trigger assembly, passively detect targets on the battlefield and prevent a suspected miss by blocking the trigger if pulled. The system is designed to only work with living targets. \n \n%c[01,255,128,0](Tip: use the firing mode key to toggle the computer functions on or off).</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_wpn_gauss_up_safari_name">
    <text>Safari-Snipe complex</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_wpn_gauss_up_safari_descr">
    <text>This system was developed with experienced military snipers in mind, for whom a missed shot can make all the difference. When activated, the trigger can be held indefinitely in a pre-fire stage and automatically fire when the shooter's aim passes over a living target. This logic is meant to counteract any potential failures from the auto-targeting system if certain camouflage patterns confuse its programming. The weapon will always fire on trigger release, regardless of where it's currently aimed. \n \n%c[01,255,128,0](Tip: use the firing mode key to toggle the computer functions on or off).</text>

  <string id="gunsl_wpn_gauss_up_ideal_name">
    <text>Ideal-M complex</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_wpn_gauss_up_ideal_descr">
    <text>Extremely effective continuous shooter assistance system. Complicated in design, easy to use, and extremely fast to operate. Just squeeze the trigger and aim at the target. The rifle will take care of the rest. Initially designed for detecting living targets but will often detect lifeless ones as well. The system proved to significantly reduce the number of misses even by novice shooters. \n \n%c[01,255,128,0](Tip: use the firing mode key to toggle the computer functions on or off).</text>
