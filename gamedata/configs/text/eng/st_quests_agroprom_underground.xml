    <text>Buzzard died trying to reach the artifact in the Fruit Punch. Judging by what he told me, his double started fussing around and pushed him into the anomaly. Strange that the artifact doesn't get picked up by my detector. Maybe it was already taken by some Red, or perhaps it's something else?</text>

    <text>It seems some rare artifact can be found here with the help of one of the dead stalkers' detector. The gun they carried wouldn't hurt either.</text>
