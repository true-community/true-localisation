    <text>Replace the magazine spring</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_hpsa_up_mag_prujina_descr">
    <text>Replacing the standard magazine spring with one that exerts a similar amount of force, but compresses to a lower height, allows the magazine to hold a slightly larger number of cartridges.</text>
