    <text>Rotten stump</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_1_descr">

    <text>Barracks</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_2_descr">
    <text>I saw a box with different kinds of supplies in the milstalker barracks. Can't just walk in there in broad daylight, but damn if I'm not tempted...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_3_name">
    <text>Box under power line</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_3_descr">
    <text>An iron box within a field of electroanomalies? Perfect spot for a stash.</text>

    <text>Supplies</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_4_descr">
    <text>I found a nice space for extra loot in a box that was once used for chemical substances. I'll leave it here for now and retrieve it later if nothing rots.</text>

    <text>Forgotten grave</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_5_descr">
    <text>Near the old passage to Yantar, I saw a stalker stuff some things into an abandoned grave. Guy's got no heart!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_6_name">
    <text>Cross on the outskirts</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_6_descr">
    <text>I decided to bring my friend's things to his grave. Can't just keep it around forever. Let him have them.</text>

    <text>Stump by trail</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_7_descr">
    <text>I had to drop off my heaviest gear near the gate to the Garbage while running from boars. I hope I can get back to the stash later and that no one touches it.</text>

    <text>Inconspicuous stash</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_8_descr">
    <text>I saw a case by the unhinged door in the helipad building where an egghead looked to be hiding stuff. Maybe he's stealing surplus materials?</text>

    <text>Army stash</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_9_descr">
    <text>I just overheard a conversation between two COs. One was boasting about a cache with some big-time loot... which, as it turns out, was snatched from stalker corpses.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_10_name">
    <text>High-rise cache</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_10_descr">
    <text>While climbing the roofs, I saw a guy on a tower rummaging around something for at least ten minutes. Looks like I know his hiding place.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_11_name">
    <text>Stump by hillside</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_11_descr">
    <text>I'll be keeping the goods in a rotten swump on the way to the tunnel. Once I tie up all loose ends, I'll be back for it.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_12_name">
    <text>Official transport</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_12_descr">

    <text>Small case</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_13_descr">
    <text>I stashed some loot by the tunnel that I won't be needing anytime soon. Just hope no one snoops around.</text>

    <text>Pipe in hole</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_14_descr">

    <text>Stash in thicket</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_15_descr">

    <text>Blockage</text>
  </string>

    <text>Worn backpack</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_17_descr">
    <text>I found a backpack with all sorts of goods near a soldier's corpse. Area's wide open, so I didn't stick my neck out. People could chase me.</text>

    <text>Hill</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_18_descr">

    <text>In the ashes</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_19_descr">
    <text>Saw a stalker through my binoculars as he threw his backpack on top of the anomalous protrusions. Didn't get what that was all about, and then he got detained by the military for some reason.</text>

    <text>Sunken transport</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_20_descr">
    <text>The front part of the sunken UAZ is still intact. Guess I'll leave my backpack there. Wouldn't want it with me if I get put under pressure by the bandit shits at the Garbage.</text>

    <text>Under the vent</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_21_descr">

    <text>Covered by foliage</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_22_descr">

    <text>Middle of the forest</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_23_descr">

    <text>Hidden safe</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_24_descr">
    <text>Caught a soldier rummaging in some safe by the scientific complex. Probably bringing something from the base. I either clear out his stuff or tell his commander... gotta give it some thought.</text>

    <text>Safe in bins</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_treasure_25_descr">

    <text>Under wagon</text>
  </string>

    <text>On the roof</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_quest_treasure_4_descr">

  </string>
  <string id="agr_quest_treasure_5_name">
    <text>Don't enter — you'll die</text>
  </string>
  <string id="agr_quest_treasure_5_descr">
    <text>Here are the coordinates to my hiding place, as thanks for helping me with those dogs. If it weren't for you, they'd have me for dinner by now.</text>
