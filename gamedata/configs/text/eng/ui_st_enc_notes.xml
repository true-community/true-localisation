Woke up in the morning and felt like horseshit. I'm sick and tired of this life, having to fetch tin cans for small change. Tonight, it's back to sitting with those deadbeats and guzzling vodka while listening to their crazy stories about how they found their first artifacts. I want good work already, something to keep me going for a while. Yurok's well off and isn't going bankrupt anytime soon, so I decided to get out of here.

To say that things hit me like a freight train would be an understatement. Everything is different now: the scientists are working on some kind of project, the factory's sealed off and they're not letting me in. They're all busy with something big, and I'm left to pick up the crumbs. I'm working as bunker security again, but the money's not the same. Even my head's started hurting; maybe spring vitamins haven't kicked in yet."\n \n%c[default]April 25, 2013\n%c[ts_pda_color]"Mutant activity is much higher, and we're barely holding them off.

Thanks for your attention and words of support. It was really nice and unexpected. After talking to you, I even thought about running somewhere far away and starting life anew, forgetting my past pain. But I barely made it to the Bar in the first place, and I could never survive in the Zone by myself. And running away from someone who helped me isn't right.\n \nCobra, though unsociable and even dangerous, helped me when everyone else turned their back. The fact that I'd have to work off the debt my whole life didn't bother me — what mattered was my mom. He paid a lot of money to that private clinic after I gave him my full share for the raid. Then she died. And everything he transferred is gone. 'No refunds,' they said. I couldn't talk to Cobra again for more work. I'm already in debt to him, even though I'm a nobody to him.
