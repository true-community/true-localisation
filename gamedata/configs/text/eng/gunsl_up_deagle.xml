    <text>Recoil compensator</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_wpn_deagle_up_barrel_compensator_descr">

  <string id="gunsl_wpn_deagle_up_barrel_hp_name">
    <text>High-pressure barrel</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_wpn_deagle_up_barrel_hp_descr">
    <text>A uniquely manufactured barrel with special rifling that forms increased pressures behind the bullet. This destabilizes it during flight and forces the bullet to take an arbitrary path on impact, forming a chaotic mess rather than a well-defined wound channel. One notable drawback to the increased damage potential is its inherent negative impact on accuracy.</text>
