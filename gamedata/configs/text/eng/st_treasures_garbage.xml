  <string id="gar_treasure_2_descr">
    <text>I squeezed some info out of a sucker on a stash of his. He and his pal are hiding all kinds of stuff there. Riches, here I come!</text>

  </string>
  <string id="gar_treasure_3_descr">
    <text>This one chump was taking a whiz in the bushes. Didn't notice when I made it off with his backpack. Think I'll hide it for some time.</text>

  <string id="gar_treasure_8_descr">

    <text>Hidden safe</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gar_treasure_12_descr">

    <text>UAZ trunk</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gar_treasure_14_descr">

    <text>Crane</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gar_treasure_16_descr">
    <text>Found a kick-ass spot near the hangar. Hard to catch with the naked eye, and I have my guys nearby, so nobody's ever getting close to it.</text>

    <text>Hangar safe</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gar_treasure_17_descr">

    <text>Backpack in wreckage</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gar_treasure_18_descr">

    <text>Muscle man's stash</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gar_treasure_19_descr">
    <text>We had this one guy... dead at this point. Anyway, on a dare, he flung an entire pipe onto the roof of the hangar shop room, and I hid my loot inside. Those were the days...</text>

  <string id="gar_treasure_20_name">
    <text>Stash in vent</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gar_treasure_20_descr">
    <text>There's some ventilation thingy linked to the hangar. Should be a good place for my stuff.</text>

    <text>Swamp log</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gar_treasure_21_descr">

    <text>Dead man's stash</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gar_treasure_22_descr">
    <text>Nobody's gonna believe how much stuff I loaded up on the other day! Man... problem is, if I take it over to my boys, they'll grab it all in a flash. Nah, I better hide it somewhere.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gar_treasure_23_name">
    <text>By the hangar</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gar_treasure_23_descr">
    <text>I found a backpack in the woods. Good find, to say the least: it's got weapons and medical supplies. Judging by the latter, the owner couldn't have been an ordinary stalker.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gar_treasure_24_name">
    <text>Anomalous stash</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gar_treasure_24_descr">

    <text>Garbage pile</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gar_treasure_25_descr">

  <string id="gar_treasure_26_name">
    <text>Hideaway in panel board</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gar_treasure_26_descr">
    <text>Man, I swear, these catacombs are something else! You could hide anything here: food, guns, ammo, even a body... oh wait.</text>

  <string id="gar_treasure_27_name">
    <text>Dead man's stuff</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gar_treasure_27_descr">
    <text>The SOB bandits popped a stalker... Good thing they didn't clean him out entirely — the rest is mine.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gar_treasure_28_name">
    <text>Soda water</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gar_treasure_28_descr">
    <text>It's amazing what you can find in these catacombs. Stumbled onto some Soviet-era water vending machines, should serve as a good place for hiding some stuff.</text>

  <string id="gar_treasure_29_name">
    <text>Stolen backpack</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gar_treasure_29_descr">
    <text>Hehe, haven't had a laugh like that in ages... The dumbass left his backpack when he went into an anomaly and forgot to get it back! What's yours is now mine!</text>

  <string id="gar_treasure_30_name">
    <text>Checkpoint box</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gar_treasure_30_descr">
    <text>Sanya, I hid your stuff by the hangar at the checkpoint, 'cause I don't trust our guys. Once you get better, pick it up, but don't take too long.</text>

    <text>Hanging backpack</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gar_treasure_31_descr">

    <text>Remnants of the past</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gar_quest_treasure_11_descr">
    <text>I'll just hide this stuff inside the anomalous cistern. After having to close up shop, it'd be a shame to leave my stuff in an undependable place.</text>
