  <string id="gunsl_val_up_rail1_name">
    <text>Weaver rail, type 1</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_rail1_descr">
    <text>Designed to mount a tactical flashlight and laser sight. The configuration prevents the addition of sights or tactical handles.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_laser_name">
    <text>Laser sight</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_laser_descr">
    <text>Visually marks the weapon's point of impact in a straight line from the muzzle. Assists with target acquisition at close range where bullet deviation and trajectory drop are less of an issue. Installation does not prevent the addition of optics or a tactical flashlight.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_torch_name">
    <text>Tactical flashlight</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_torch_descr">
    <text>A long-range, narrow-field flashlight to assist with nighttime exploration and eliminates the need to hold one separately. Installation does not prevent the addition of a laser sight.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_rail2_name">
    <text>Weaver rail, type 2</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_rail2_descr">
    <text>Designed to mount a tactical handle and a variety of optics, however its unsuitable for laser sights or tactical flashlights.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_handle_name">
    <text>Tactical handle</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_handle_descr">
    <text>Installation of a tactical handle under the barrel makes the gun easier to handle and allows the shooter to compensate for recoil more effectively.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_light_mag_name">
    <text>Lightweight magazine</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_light_mag_descr">
    <text>Replacing the magazine with a modern lightweight equivalent reduces the overall weight of the gun slightly.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_reliability_barrel_name">
    <text>Improved heat dissipation</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_reliability_barrel_descr">
    <text>The integrated suppressor gets subjected to very hot propellant gasses during firing, a necessary evil for it to function as intended. Improving its ability to transfer this heat more efficiently can noticeable extend its service life.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_accuracy_usm_name">
    <text>Calibrate the trigger group</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_accuracy_usm_descr">
    <text>Precision adjustment and balancing of the trigger components allows for higher accuracy and reduced recoil.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_rpm_usm_name">
    <text>Reinforced trigger assembly</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_rpm_usm_descr">
    <text>A refined trigger assembly allows for a faster rate of fire at the expense of some overall reliability.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_body_reliability_name">
    <text>Protective coating</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_body_reliability_descr">
    <text>The application of a special coating to the moving components can significantly reduce the amount of wear they receive.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_tilnik_name">
    <text>Rubberized buttplate</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_tilnik_descr">
    <text>Installation of a rubberized buttplate on the stock absorbs much of the recoil felt by the shooter.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_sights_name">
    <text>Tritium inserts</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_sights_descr">
    <text>Installation of luminous night-sights allows for easier target acquisition in low-light conditions.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_barrel_speed_name">
    <text>Barrel re-cutting</text>
  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_val_up_barrel_speed_descr">
    <text>Changing the rifling pitch in the barrel can improve muzzle velocity for a flatter bullet trajectory.</text>
