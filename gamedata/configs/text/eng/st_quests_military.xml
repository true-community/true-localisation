    <text>Koval is dead — in saving me, he sacrificed his own life. At any rate, I need to finish what was started. Perhaps I'm close to the truth already. Right now, I'm to track down the local trader, who should help me get in contact with the stalkers that encountered the unknown group... and that group most likely has a part in the professor's disappearance.</text>
