  <string id="labx18_map_treasure_search_stalker_text">
    <text>Trukhlyay said that an experienced stalker went missing somewhere in X18. Perhaps I'll stumble onto him... or his body.</text>

    <text>Investigate the area marked on the map</text>
  </string>
  <string id="labx18_map_treasure_check_new_location_text">
    <text>I found a map on the wealthy stalker's body with a highlighted area that likely has something to do with Freedom. I should check it out. The fact that it's located in bandit territory might be a problem, though...</text>

    <text>I'm an idiot. I knew I shouldn't have trusted those bandit bastards! They'll pay for this one way or another.</text>

  <string id="labx18_inspect_level_alone_two_text">
    <text>I should've helped the bandits deal with the mutants, but oh well. They'll probably manage just fine while I go examine the laboratory. They probably wouldn't have came along anyway.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="labx18_inspect_level_alone_three_text">
    <text>The mutants are dead. I'll go check what's happening on the lower levels. I don't think those crooks would've gone with me — they seem a bit too suspicious.</text>

    <text>A stalker attacked me at the exit. Looks like he's from... Freedom? I should check his body for anything important.</text>
