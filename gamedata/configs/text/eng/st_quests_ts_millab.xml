    <text>Talk to Termite</text>
  </string>
  <string id="mlab_stalker_fate_task_text">
    <text>Kalinskiy told me that Termite allegedly killed a stalker named Axe after he helped us carry out the artifacts selection. Hearing this left me outraged; we cannot afford to lose such valuable personnel like him. I need to head to our security department to figure out what happened.</text>

  </string>
  <string id="mlab_trials_task_start_text">
    <text>Our superiors overseeing the laboratory have set a new goal of studying the possibility of reversing mutations in the Zone. Several civilian zombies who have wandered the Chornobyl Zone for several years have been located and taken in as test subjects. Perhaps, we could least partially return them to normal life soon. Today we will be conducting the first set of experiments. The work ahead of us will demand painstaking efforts.</text>

    <text>Wait until the experiments are finished</text>

  <string id="mlab_trials_task_wait_text">

  <string id="mlab_trials_task_final_text">
    <text>I've received a call, likely from our superiors regarding the tests. I should go to my office and pick up the phone.</text>

    <text>Head deeper into the laboratory</text>
  </string>
  <string id="mlab_final_task_start_text">
    <text>I've managed to enter the underground area. God knows what or who lives here. Apparently there's some sort of laboratory here too. This place is probably filled with traps, so I should be on my guard as I move deeper. My objective is to find Dubinin and figure out what kind of place this is.</text>

  <string id="mlab_final_task_search_merc_leader_text">
    <text>The professor is dead. I don't know whether I made the right choice or not, but he clearly never intended to turn himself in. Now I have to finish searching the laboratory, and find Termite.</text>

    <text>I couldn't locate Termite, but at least his cutthroats are all dead. Now I need to evacuate the survivors.</text>
