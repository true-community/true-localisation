  <string id="af_rusty_thorn_descr">
    <text>The result of the interaction between the Chemical anomaly and the body of an inattentive stalker. The spiky artefact prickles the owner's body, no matter how it is attached. But it also helps to purify the body from the progenitor — chemical gases. Quite common and cheap.</text>

  </string>
  <string id="st_af_tuber_descr">

    <text>Mumieux</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_af_mumiyo_descr">
    <text>A rare artefact born in areas with very high psy radiation. It has enormous properties of electrical resistance and, unfortunately, emits quanta of light (gamma radiation) at a high frequency, which can give the bearer radiation sickness.</text>

  <string id="st_af_oskolok_shmatok_descr">
    <text>Fragile fragment of soft rock, degeneration zone, has no positive properties, as well as negative ones. Scientists would be willing to pay for the study of this specimen.</text>

    <text>Dog's heart</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_esc_stalker_liar_artefact_descr">
    <text>This artefact is quite rare, and its appearance on the outskirts of the Zone remains a mystery. The heart emits waves with healing properties similar to those of such artefacts as Soul and its like, and, among other things, makes the wearer's skin rougher, protecting it from cuts and scratches. Despite its beneficial properties, the artefact is radioactive and caution should be used.</text>
