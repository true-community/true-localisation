  </string>
  <string id="yan_start_task_go_text">
    <text>We arrived at the site of the operation. I've decided to leave Sky to protect the pilot. He's attempting to facilitate a connection to the satellite to keep us informed on what's happening here. The others and I have to examine the scientists' bunker. I hope we'll find all the answers we need there, as scouring the whole area won't be a pleasant experience.</text>

    <text>Examine the area around the bunker</text>

  <string id="yan_start_task_check_territory_text">

    <text>Gather all information in the bunker</text>
  </string>
  <string id="yan_start_task_check_bunker_text">
    <text>Command's primary objective is to gather all information on the scientists' research at lake Yantar. We'll need to gather all documentation, personal PDAs of the scientists and data storage devices. I'll start with the bunker. I'll go on my own, as it'll be quieter.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="yan_start_task_go_back_name">
    <text>Give the information to Sky</text>
  </string>
  <string id="yan_start_task_go_back_text">
    <text>I gathered all the information I could found in the scientists' bunker. Everyone inside was either dead or turned into zombies — including Sakharov. The data I found needs to be given to Sky, and after decoding some of it, we'll decide how to proceed.</text>

  <string id="yan_something_in_silence_talk_koval_text">
    <text>A strange anomaly has been spotted in the swamp by the mobile lab. Koval and I will go examine it. While we're at it, I'll put him through his paces.</text>

    <text>Go to the anomaly site with Koval</text>
  </string>
  <string id="yan_something_in_silence_go_koval_text">
    <text>One of our objectives from command is gathering all information on happenings at lake Yantar, including information on anomalous formations. I believe that's why Koval was assigned to our squad, being well-versed in anomalies.</text>

    <text>Talk to Koval</text>

    <text>Cover Koval</text>
  </string>
  <string id="yan_something_in_silence_cover_koval_text">
    <text>Koval claims he's never seen such an anomaly before. And was it even an anomaly? Gathering intelligence on it wouldn't hurt. While Koval sets up his device, I should provide cover.</text>

    <text>Take the stalker to the camp</text>
  </string>
  <string id="yan_someone_alive_follow_stalker_text">
    <text>We've found the first survivor in Yantar. He should be able to clear up recent events and help give us a complete picture of everything. To begin with, I should take him to camp and let him come to his senses — he's been through a lot.</text>

  <string id="yan_someone_alive_talk_with_stalker_name">
    <text>Interrogate the stalker</text>
  </string>
  <string id="yan_someone_alive_talk_with_stalker_text">
    <text>I should get as much information out of the stalker as possible. What does he know about the scientists' work at Yantar, what was that black fume chasing him? There are enough questions as it is.</text>

    <text>Wait for Koval to appear</text>
  </string>
  <string id="yan_missing_koval_wait_text">
    <text>The dimwit disappeared somewhere. I don't believe anything happened to him. I'll wait until he shows up, and in the meantime, I can get around to other objectives.</text>

    <text>Track down Koval by his signal</text>
  </string>
  <string id="yan_missing_koval_spot_seen_text">
    <text>Koval's gone silent, but I've picked up his signal near the archanomaly. I'll check the area. What's he doing here?</text>

    <text>Help Koval fight off the mutants</text>

  </string>
  <string id="yan_collect_info_search_text">
    <text>Sky transferred the possible sites of scientist bodies to my PDA. I should examine them and retrieve any information. Hottab and Vuslych set off to check the area leading to Agroprom. I'll check the area surrounding the factory.</text>

  </string>
  <string id="yan_collect_info_talk_with_sky_text">

  </string>
  <string id="yan_labx16_task_start_text">
    <text>To help us reach the body of one of the stalkers near laboratory X-16, Sky found a way to reduce the intensity of the psy-emissions around the lab's main entrance. The stalker may have useful information that will shed light on the events here.</text>

  <string id="yan_labx16_task_second_escape_lab_text">
    <text>I wound up inside the laboratory ruins with no way out. Seems I'm still in one piece, no fractures or anything, but my radio's broken to pieces. I'll have to get back on the surface on my own. On the plus side, this place will likely allow me to piece together everything that happened at Yantar.</text>

    <text>My encounter with Ivanych turned out unexpectedly. I never thought I'd get to see him alive again. He told me the individual we met around here is not to be trusted. How did he know about that? I'll need to question the stalker once more — Ivanych must have meant him. While I look for the exit, I'll check out his overnight shelter. Ivanych told me it's somewhere in the sewers.</text>

    <text>A stalker named Matvei told me everything about the mysterious stranger. He lied to me from the very start with the sole purpose of getting out of here.
