	<string id="gunsl_glock17_up_mag19_descr">
		<text>Higher-capacity magazines means fewer reloads during combat and improves the odds of survival.</text>

		<text>High-capacity magazine (33 rounds)</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gunsl_glock17_up_mag33_descr">
		<text>Extended double-stacked magazines hold significantly more ammunition than standard issue and greatly reduce the number of reloads needed during combat, effectively improving survival odds.</text>

		<text>Automatic firing mode</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gunsl_glock17_up_usm_fullauto_descr">
		<text>Complete replacement of the breech-block and modification of the firing mechanism allows for an automatic firing mode. The gun's components must be replaced with non-standard parts to handle the significant increase in material stresses, which dramatically reduces overall accuracy and reliability.</text>

	<string id="gunsl_glock17_up_usm_3x_name">
		<text>3-round burst cutoff mechanism</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gunsl_glock17_up_usm_3x_descr">
		<text>A compromise between fully automatic and single-shot firing modes. The retrofit modifies certain key assemblies (e.g. replacement of the bolt carrier), but because the additional forces generated are relatively low, most original factory-spec components can be retained. This allows for a much lower loss in accuracy and reliability to produce performance very similar to that of the fully automatic version.</text>

	<string id="gunsl_glock17_up_laser_descr">
		<text>Visually marks the weapon's point of impact in a straight line from the muzzle. Assists with target acquisition at close range where bullet deviation and trajectory drop are less of an issue. Installation does not prevent the addition of optics or a tactical flashlight.</text>

	<string id="gunsl_glock17_up_torch_name">
		<text>Tactical flashlight</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="gunsl_glock17_up_torch_descr">
		<text>A long-range, narrow-field flashlight to assist with nighttime exploration and eliminates the need to hold one separately. Installation does not prevent the addition of a laser sight.</text>
