    <text>What do you need?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_dialog_start_0">
    <text>Phew... I think we lost 'em. That was strange — our guy was meant to be on guard duty and they shouldn't have noticed us. Something didn't go as planned and someone else took over. I'll deal with it later; I can't lead around rookies like this.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_dialog_start_1">
    <text>It happens. Haven't been in the Zone for a while and I'm already wheezing from a little run!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_dialog_start_2">
    <text>Yeah. Shame we couldn't get through this time. This path is gonna be closed off for a while... Next time, we gotta make sure the right guy is keeping watch.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_dialog_start_3">
    <text>Don't worry. We're alive, and that's a good sign.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_dialog_start_4">
    <text>Damn right. Let's plop down by the fire and drink to our escape. Can't go anywhere in this weather anyway.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_dialog_start_5">
    <text>Sounds good!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_camp_0">
    <text>So what made you want to return to the Zone?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_camp_1">
    <text>What can I say? After a couple of times here, I can't stop thinking about it. This is where I want to be.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_camp_2">
    <text>Everyone tells me the exact same thing: that you all have something in common... or, should I say, that *we* have something in common. I can't put my finger on what's keeping me here either. Truth be told, I try to stay within the Cordon, though the rookies here keep my pocket full — they need a guide almost every day. It's a shame many of them either disappear or die. Here's to it not happening any more!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_camp_3">
    <text>Cheers!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_camp_4">
    <text>Ah, that hit the spot! I myself went into the Zone with my buddy Vitka. At that time, my son died in a car crash... my bitch wife went binge-drinking... I'm an emotional man, so I got real worried. I met up with Vitka, we shared a bottle or two — just like you and I are now — and my tongue loosened up and I started telling him about my problems. At that point, nothing was keeping me home, so I took up his offer of heading into the Zone to unwind.\n \nWhile on the way there, he told me how he already had experience in the Zone. Shared a lot of interesting stuff with me, but with the state I was in at that time, I didn't pay much attention to it — I was looking to take my mind off things after what happened anyway. Then we went to the Cordon... Hey, don't forget to snack!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_camp_5">
    <text>Yeah, man, life sure hit you hard... Let's have another one...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_camp_6">
    <text>It happens, right? Now, as for Vitka, he decided to head off beyond the Cordon. Poor bastard paid the price for it... Haven't heard from him in half a year, and all I get from asking the newcomers from the Garbage about him is a shrug. Some real shit started happening there... tons of bandit trash, anomalies all over the map... but despite of all of that, you don't understand what keeps you here in this goddamned Zone... Deep inside, maybe you're hoping to meet your friend who survived by some miracle?... I'll pour you another one...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_camp_7">
    <text>Tragic story. Don't even know what to say...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_camp_8">
    <text>Don't worry about it. Let's have another one!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_camp_9">
    <text>I'm really feeling it... I barely drink at all, but the occasion deserves it. Another one!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_take_job_0">
    <text>Hi. What do you need?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_take_job_1">
    <text>Hey there, Sidorovich! I'm back in the Zone and ready for work. Got anything?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_take_job_2">
    <text>You're back? I never saw you here before.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_take_job_3">
    <text>C'mon, Sid, you can't be serious. It's me, Axe!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_take_job_4">
    <text>Aah! That's right! Axe! The one who made his way into the Zone with nothing more than an axe on his shoulders!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_take_job_5">
    <text>For the record, I did chop up a dog.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_take_job_6">
    <text>Could've fooled me. Our boys wounded it while you only put that poor mutant out of its misery.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_take_job_7">
    <text>Okay, well, enough with the pleasantries. Got any work for me?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_take_job_8">
    <text>First, you oughta get yourself some sleep after your binge drinking last night, and *then* come back for work.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_take_job_9">
    <text>Well, I have...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_take_job_10">
    <text>Fooled me again, hah! Anyway, I've got a couple of assignments for you. My artifact hunter left to harvest his crop and disappeared somewhere. My thought is that either he found something valuable and ran off with it or the dogs there found something "valuable" and made him their lunch. Go there and have a look, will you? There's an anomaly in the tunnel under the bridge, which is precisely where he was going.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_take_job_11">
    <text>What's the pay?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_take_job_12_1">
    <text>Show me some results and we'll talk. You have all the equipment you need. Just don't let the soldiers catch you — I hear they raised the alarm last night and went looking for someone. Must be those good-for-nothing rookies! Can't even pass the checkpoint without being spotted.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_take_job_12_2">
    <text>Show me some results and we'll talk. Here's a piece to get you started. Just don't let the soldiers catch you — I hear they raised the alarm last night and went looking for someone. Must be those good-for-nothing rookies! Can't even pass the checkpoint without being spotted.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_take_job_13">
    <text>Yeah, they really blew it, didn't they? Alright, I'm off to the tunnel.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_kutek_dialog_0">
    <text>Shit... Busted.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_kutek_dialog_1">
    <text>How's this possible? Your PDA's on that body! I thought you were dead!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_kutek_dialog_2">
    <text>See, that's the thing: I wanted everyone to think I'm a goner. I'm tired of doing Sid's errands for free! I'm in debt to him... and it's a whole lot of money, let me tell you! Can't just walk away from it, and it'd take months before I work it all off, so I cooked up this little plan: found this poor bastard who ran into a bunch of dogs, dressed him in my clothing and left my PDA.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_kutek_dialog_3">
    <text>You're really something! Why'd you come back, then?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_kutek_dialog_4">
    <text>I dropped my detector near the tunnel. Can't let that stuff go to waste.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_kutek_dialog_5">
    <text>Alright, don't you worry. I won't tell Sid.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_kutek_dialog_6">
    <text>For real? Wow, thanks! I would've given you something as a reward, but I'm stripped for just about everything. I'm on my way to Agroprom. Might have luck in finding something there. Here, all I've got is an energy drink — a little present for you!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_kutek_dialog_7">
    <text>This'll come handy if I need to save my skin. Right, good luck!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_kutek_idle_dialog_0">
    <text>Just don't tell the trader anything, stalker.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_kutek_idle_dialog_1">
    <text>Don't you worry. I won't.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_collector_arts_0">
    <text>Well, Sid, your Kutyok is done for.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_collector_arts_1">
    <text>What happened?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_collector_arts_2_1">
    <text>Mauled to death by the dogs. His remains are near the tunnel. Here's his PDA.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_collector_arts_2_2">
    <text>I found him by the tunnel — he's dog food now. Got his PDA and an artifact from the tunnel.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_collector_arts_2_3">
    <text>Nothing's happened yet, but you can set things right. He decided to fool you.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_collector_arts_3_1">
    <text>Well, that's the Zone for you! Real shame — he was a good collector. The guy could do jobs for three men whenever the need arose... What matters is that he was honest. Who will ever take his place, I wonder?...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_collector_arts_3_2">
    <text>Great job. As for the artifact, I'll give you another five hundred on top and that's that. Real shame — he was a good collector. The guy did the work of three men whenever the need arose... What matters is that he was honest. Who will ever take his place, I wonder?...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_collector_arts_3_3">
    <text>Really, now?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_collector_arts_4_1">
    <text>I don't know. I could try, if that's okay with you?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_collector_arts_4_2">
    <text>He left his PDA on someone's body and planned on leaving. Told me he's hiding because he owes you a lot. I just happened to find him when he was coming back to get his detector.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_collector_arts_4_3">
    <text>He left his PDA on someone's body and planned on leaving. Told me he's hiding because he owes you a lot. I just happened to find him when he was coming back to get his detector. On top of that, here's an artifact.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_collector_arts_5_1">
    <text>Why not? Just remember that the pay's not the best. I won't part with more than one and a half grand for every artifact, but we'll wait and see what you'll bring in. You can get rid of that ancient detector of yours... here's a real one for you. Don't forget to give it back!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_collector_arts_5_2">
    <text>Say what? That son of a...! Once I find him, he'll regret it. Here's a little more for your honesty.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_collector_arts_5_3">
    <text>Say what? That son of a...! Once I find him, he'll regret it. Here's a little more for your honesty, and for the artifact.</text>
  </string>

    <text>Works for me. Give me the coordinates.</text>
  </string>

    <text>Phew. Done with the artifact job.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_find_arts_1">
    <text>Well done. Show me what you've scrounged up.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_find_arts_2">
    <text>Here. That's all I could find.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_find_arts_3">
    <text>This'll do perfectly well! Here's your well-deserved money, fair and square.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_find_arts_4">
    <text>Are you out of your mind? This isn't even half of what the artifacts are worth! I almost got wasted for them, and you're giving me nothing for it!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_find_arts_5">
    <text>Now, now, Axe, don't get your shorts in a twist. I can't give you any more. At the end of the day, I gave you a good detector — how would you have found the artifacts without it? Find more after this and I'll buy it for a good price. By the way, Fanatic wanted to see you outside. Says he's got a dog lair that needs taking care of, and he could use the extra firepower... so hurry on up!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_find_arts_6">
    <text>Haven't changed a bit, you old fart.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_notebook_dialog_0">
    <text>Sid, where's your laptop? You had it last year. Did it break?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_notebook_dialog_1">
    <text>Yeah, it broke... Now I'm sitting here working this clunky piece of garbage. Oh, thanks for reminding me: I need you to swing by the technician's place in the village. I left him my laptop for repair two months ago... He must've fixed it by now, and since he hasn't gotten off his ass and brought it here himself, go there, talk to him, and bring it back here.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_notebook_dialog_2">
    <text>If there's anyone who should get off their ass, Sid, it's you! Sitting here and bossing people around...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_notebook_dialog_3">
    <text>Just do as I say — there's a little reward in it for you. You won't be rich, but I'll make it worth your while. You'd be passing by there anyway!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_notebook_dialog_4_1">
    <text>Alright, you've convinced me. I'll be right back.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_notebook_dialog_4_2">
    <text>No, Sid. I'm not gonna run errands for you. Get me something more serious...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_notebook_dialog_second_0">
    <text>I was thinking... I got a little worked up. Do you still need me to get the laptop?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_notebook_dialog_second_1">
    <text>Oh, it's nothing. Yeah, I sure wouldn't mind having it here right now...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_notebook_dialog_second_2">
    <text>I'm off, then.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_notebook_dialog_mechanic_0">
    <text>Hey, Mikhalych! I'm here for Sid's laptop. Did you fix it?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_notebook_dialog_mechanic_1">
    <text>Yeah, good thing you stopped by. I don't have the time to play delivery boy for that clown. Take the laptop and give him my warmest regards.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_notebook_dialog_mechanic_2">
    <text>Got it. See you later.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_robbery_bandit_dialog_0">
    <text>Ey, punk, empty everything you found in the anomaly and make it quick!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_robbery_bandit_dialog_1">
    <text>Is that your anomaly?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_robbery_bandit_dialog_2">
    <text>The hell do you mean, "my anomaly"? Just doing a routine pocket inspection, dumbass!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_robbery_bandit_dialog_3_1">
    <text>Sure, take it. You won't get away with it, though.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_robbery_bandit_dialog_3_2">
    <text>You'll hurt yourself with a pea shooter like that.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_robbery_bandit_dialog_4_1">
    <text>I'll be fine anyhow. Now get lost!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_robbery_bandit_dialog_4_2">
    <text>Well, uh... I warned you, if anything. If I were in your shoes, I'd be real careful about where I go around here.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_robbery_bandit_dialog_5_1">
    <text>Bye.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_robbery_bandit_dialog_5_2">
    <text>If I were you, I'd shut my mouth.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mechanic_repair_dialog_0">
    <text>It's me again. Fanatic sent me — says you're the gun-fixer here. Could you repair my AK?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mechanic_repair_dialog_1">
    <text>Later, okay? I told you, I've got tons of work right now. Leave it here and I'll fix it later.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mechanic_repair_dialog_2">
    <text>Here. Do you maybe have some work for me, then? While you're busy, I could help out — I don't have any money to pay you for the repair.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mechanic_repair_dialog_3">
    <text>Actually, you could help me right now! Got a little something that needs taking care of...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mechanic_repair_dialog_4">
    <text>What's it about?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mechanic_repair_dialog_5">
    <text>Every night in the lowlands — that's where the radioactive swamp is — I've been seeing these strange hovering lights. It's gotta be artifacts, and very rare ones, too! I went there at daytime but didn't find anything. Seems like they only come out at night... and the night has its own dangers. I'm a technician, not a combatant, and there've been enough mutants around recently.\n \nIf you can check out that place and retrieve the artifacts, I'll fix your rifle and give you a discount on future orders. What do you say?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mechanic_repair_dialog_6_1">
    <text>I'm in. It'll be hard without the rifle, so I don't have any choice.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mechanic_repair_dialog_6_2">
    <text>I've been there at night. I can tell you that those are poltergeists, but I'll go check it again for good measure.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mechanic_repair_dialog_6_3">
    <text>I've been there at night. I can tell you that those are poltergeists, and I've already dealt with them. Unfortunately for you, there are no artifacts there.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mechanic_repair_dialog_7_1">
    <text>Then have a couple of antirads for the trip. Don't be long there. Good luck!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mechanic_repair_dialog_7_2">
    <text>Of course, check it. Have a couple of antirads for the trip, and try to make it quick. Good luck!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mechanic_repair_dialog_7_3">
    <text>Crap, and here I was all excited... Alright. Leave your AK here and I'll call when the repair's done.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mechanic_repair_dialog_8_1">
    <text>I'll be back soon.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mechanic_repair_dialog_8_2">

    <text>Great.</text>

  </string>
  <string id="esc_mechanic_quest_polters_night_0">

  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_notebook_dialog_complete_1">
    <text>Finally I can work with something half-decent! I just need to finish up and save some stuff. As for you, here's a little present. Now, go rest.</text>

    <text>I'll take that.</text>

    <text>I'll be right there!</text>

    <text>I'm on it.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mechanic_quest_polters_compl_1_2">
    <text>So, Mikhalych, what freaking "artifacts" were you on about? All I found were poltergeists, and three of them!</text>

  <string id="esc_mechanic_quest_polters_compl_2">
    <text>Really? Aw, crap...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mechanic_quest_polters_compl_3_1">
    <text>Yeah, it was a bunch of crap! I barely took 'em down.</text>

    <text>Yeah, it was a bunch of crap! I barely saved my own hide!</text>

    <text>Well, shit. They had a real glow to them...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mechanic_quest_polters_compl_5">
    <text>Yeah, sure. I don't care what was glowing. Fix my AK.</text>
  </string>

    <text>Deal.</text>

  <string id="esc_mechanic_repair_ar_fialog_final_0">
    <text>Okay, show me how my battle-scarred AK is doing.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mechanic_repair_ar_fialog_final_1_1">
    <text>Here. Your AK's just like new! If you ever need anything else fixed, come by. I've got more free time for that now.</text>

  <string id="esc_mechanic_repair_ar_fialog_final_1_2">
    <text>Here. Your AK's just like new! And, to compensate for that trouble with the poltergeists, some ammo — now I'm sure nothing else will enter that anomaly. If you ever need anything else fixed, come by. I've got more free time for that now.</text>

    <text>Now we're talking!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="fanat_logovo_dialog_7">
    <text>Okay, listen up. The four of us are planning to shoot down the pseudodogs — we're sick of them and their attacks on the village. Those things breed like rabbits! They usually hang out somewhere by the vehicle station, but we're not just going to put them down. We need to find their lair and blow it to kingdom come!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="fanat_logovo_dialog_8">
    <text>What's the plan?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="fanat_logovo_dialog_9">
    <text>Wolf hid some dynamite near the locomotive. If you leave the village and follow the road to the railway bank, turn right and keep going until you see it. That's where you have to look. Find the dynamite and head to the place we've marked out. While we cover you, shoot down the dogs and place the dynamite by the hole, then we blow it up. Easier said than done, but we'll manage. Don't be long!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="fanat_logovo_dialog_10">
    <text>Got it. I'm going.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="fanat_logovo_wait_dialog_0">
    <text>Did you get the dynamite? Hurry up, we're preparing!</text>

  <string id="fanat_idle_dialog_0">
    <text>What is it?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="fanat_idle_dialog_good_0">
    <text>Hey, Axe! Need something?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="fanat_logovo_complete_0">
    <text>Phew! That was intense, but we did things quick! I hope this'll discourage those beasts from multiplying for a while. Here's some money and an AK, like I promised... though, it needs a repair. It's battered as it is, and if you try to fire it, it'll quite literally jam every shot.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="fanat_logovo_complete_1">
    <text>Where can I fix it? Is there anyone with the know-how?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="fanat_logovo_complete_2">
    <text>There's a technician in the village. Mikhalych is his name. Ask him. He won't repair it for free, but I believe you two can strike a deal.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="fanat_logovo_complete_3">
    <text>Got it. Thanks!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="fanat_logovo_complete_4">
    <text>We're heading back to the village. You with us?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="fanat_logovo_complete_5_1">
    <text>Yeah, let's go. I'll visit Mikhalych and tell him about the gun.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="fanat_logovo_complete_5_2">
    <text>I'll stay here. You go — we'll catch up later.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_friend_quest_dialog_0">
    <text>Hold up, buddy. You free? Got a job for you. You might recognize me — we cleared out the dog lair together with Fanatic.</text>

    <text>Of course. Tell me.</text>

    <text>Some other time.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_friend_quest_dialog_2_1">
    <text>You know Yurok, our guide, right? Basically, this one guy borrowed money from him and isn't giving it back. Yurok saved my life once, so I want to return the favor and bring him the money, but my place is here in the village and I can't bring myself to leave it. I know where the guy's usually hiding, so all you need to do is shake down the money from him — if he doesn't cooperate, you know what to do. You bring me eight thousand and I'll pass it on to Yurok as thanks for saving me; feel free to keep the rest. I'll also get you something nice as a reward. I've got the coordinates here. You up for it?</text>

    <text>Yeah, of course. The scumbag usually hangs by the grain elevator, snooping around for something. Get the dough and I'll make it worth your while. As I've said, I need eight thousand — you can take the rest, and I'll give you something else on top.</text>

    <text>What do you mean, "where was I"? I was leading these idiots around. Did you forget my trade? Can't say I've got any news... Got myself a new shooter recently, but other than that, it's the same old thing. So I'm pouring, hehe.</text>

Got myself a new shooter recently, but other than that, it's the same old thing.\n \nBy the way, take this radio. I found it on the body of one of the soldiers I was telling you about. It's all he had — should be of use. Seems like someone pocketed them for their guns and belongings before I did and didn't grab the radio for some reason. Might not have noticed it. Better use that thing to contact me instead of your PDA if anything secret comes up, haha. Now, let's drink!</text>

    <text>Oof, that was a good one! So what's new with you? Still thinking about going to the Garbage? Just thinking about all those bandits... Gives me the chills, man!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_buhaem_5_1">
    <text>It's chugging along. I'm working for Sid. Dare you to find a bigger cheapskate in the whole Zone... And what's wrong with the Garbage? I've been wanting to see new parts of the Zone for ages. Just think about it, eh? And not just the Garbage — there are tons of wicked places! Oh, I almost forgot: it's a good thing you gave me the tip-off on the jarheads. I checked that place out and found a solid radio on a body, just like the one you have. This means we can get in touch even when our PDAs have no signal.</text>

    <text>The radio will come in handy for sure. I thought those poor fellas were gonna be completely strapped for loot... So, what were we talking about...? New places? What's "wicked" about it? Just a whole bunch of old abandoned buildings — we have enough of those on the outside. The main difference there — and not a good one, I tell you — is that once you nod off, you're gonna take something in the back! Is that what you want?</text>

    <text>Naw, buddy. Thanks. I'm fine right where I am. I'm fed and dressed, I've got money... what else? Sorry, but I'll pass. Man, let's cut the talking and get drinking!</text>

    <text>Ugh, Axe... if you're really gonna make your trip, watch yourself. The Zone ain't a picnic... You should know many folks have died there. It's terrible stuff to think about! Take my pal Vitka as an example. I've known the guy since we were in diapers, and he decided to make a move beyond the Cordon. We kept in touch for a couple of days, and after that... well, it's been half a year, and I've heard nothing from him. Must've died in those parts... Let's drink...</text>

    <text>Let's drink up! And how do you know how many people have died there, hmm? Those are all tales. I'll go check it myself and find your Vitka while I'm at it, hehe. If I come back, it means all the talk about it being dangerous is a lie.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_buhaem_12">
    <text>Man, I'm just sitting here and thinking... I have no one to talk to but you. No one... You're like a brother to me. Don't go beyond the Cordon — you'll regret it! Think of all the living proof of that!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_buhaem_13">
    <text>Don't get too soft. It'll be alright! I'll just head there and back, then I'll share my impressions with you. "Living proof"... I'm a lucky guy, and I'll get through in one piece. And neither do I have anyone besides you... Another glass!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_buhaem_14">
    <text>It's an unnecessary risk, buddy. You're young and rash... You'll be gone in the blink of an eye. Veterans, if not masters, have died in those places, and you think you can do better? Listen to yourself. There's nothing to do there!... Another glass?</text>

    <text>I understand... What needs doing?</text>

    <text>Hey. What are you doing here?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_dialog_2">
    <text>Imagine this: I'm walking down the road and I see a car! Looks unused, too! Might've been the army that left it here — they tried starting it, but there's no gas, which is why they left it.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_dialog_3">
    <text>Leave that hunk of junk here. What are you gonna do with wheels in the Zone?</text>

  <string id="esc_stalker_car_dialog_4">
    <text>I have a few plans. Listen, could you help me out?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_dialog_5">
    <text>Sorry, but I ain't pushing it all the way to the village.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_dialog_6">
    <text>No need for pushing. Our technician in the village has some gas. You run off there while I keep watch over the car. I'll share a little present with you too! Deal?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_dialog_7_1">
    <text>Okay, fine. I'll go get the gas for you. Hope the present is worth it...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_dialog_7_2">
    <text>Nah, man. You think I have nothing else to do than to run marathons for your gas? I'm off.</text>
  </string>

    <text>Okay, sure! You go about your business! I'll just wait here for some good soul!</text>
  </string>

    <text>Mikhalych, you don't have a can of gas, do you?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_technic_dialog_1">
    <text>Why ask? What do you want with it?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_technic_dialog_2">
    <text>This one guy found a nice car, but it's empty and needs refueling. Could you hand over a canister?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_technic_dialog_3">
    <text>Well, I'll be! The guy finds a car and I'm supposed to spare my gas for him just like that?... Why don't you feed my pockets with a thousand and it's a deal, alright?</text>

  <string id="esc_stalker_car_technic_dialog_4_1">
    <text>Ugh... Here's your grand, you cheapskate.</text>
  </string>

    <text>Well, screw you then! I'll manage somehow.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_technic_dialog_5_1">
    <text>Gas is a rare commodity around here, so I hope you understand my position as a "cheapskate"... Here's your canister. There ain't much inside, just so you know.</text>

  <string id="esc_stalker_car_technic_dialog_6_1">
    <text>Alright. Have a good day.</text>

    <text>As you say.</text>

  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wait_dialog_0">
    <text>So, did you get the gas?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wait_dialog_1_1">
    <text>I got. Here.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wait_dialog_1_2">
    <text>Not yet. Wait here.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wait_dialog_1_3">
    <text>Sorry, but I changed my mind.</text>
  </string>

    <text>Oh, hell yeah! Great job, man! Here, you deserve it!</text>

    <text>Damn, thanks! What are you gonna do with this ride now?</text>

  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wait_dialog_2_3">
    <text>Well, screw you, then! I'll find someone else.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wait_dialog_3_3">
    <text>Good luck...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wait_dialog_4_1">
    <text>I'll wait here for a friend of mine and decide with him. But you did your job, and that's what matters. Alright, bye, man.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wait_dialog_5_1">
    <text>Good luck to you!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wound_dialog_0">
    <text>Shit, this hurts like a...!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wound_dialog_1">
    <text>What happened? Who did this to you?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wound_dialog_2">
    <text>Damn bandits did it! They saw me... and opened fire instantly!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wound_dialog_3">
    <text>Hold on. I'll take a look at your wound.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wound_dialog_4">
    <text>They tried starting the car before they figured out it was out of gas, then went back to their camp to get some. I'm pretty sure it's at the Garbage...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wound_dialog_5">
    <text>You got lucky there. The bullet went right through, but it looks like no vital parts were hit. I tried closing the wound, but you need to get back to the village before they return.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wound_dialog_6">
    <text>I'll try getting back... You be careful too. Don't let 'em catch ya.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wound_dialog_7">
    <text>You taking the canister with you? I don't need it.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wound_dialog_8">
    <text>Oh yeah, that's right... If you deal with the bandits, I think I can get back here to the car. Gimme the can... They'll be here any minute, so keep 'em busy — I can't move that fast... Almost forgot, here you go for the trouble!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wound_dialog_9">
    <text>Thanks! See you around, man... if the Zone is kind to us.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wound_reversed_task_dialog_0">
    <text>Shit, man... Hurts like a son of a gun!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wound_reversed_task_dialog_1">
    <text>What happened? Where'd those bastards go?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wound_reversed_task_dialog_2">
    <text>Yeah, good question... They went to get gas after they realized the car's empty. They opened fire instantly and thought they got me... They'll be back in a second. We gotta hurry... Thanks for coming here, stalker. I won't forget it.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wound_reversed_task_dialog_3">
    <text>Of course I'd help. How are you? Can you walk? Let me see. The bullet went right through — you're lucky. But you need to get back to the village either way.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wound_reversed_task_dialog_4">
    <text>Don't worry. I'll get back... Thanks again. Here's for responding to my call. Good luck.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wound_reversed_task_dialog_5">
    <text>Don't mention it. Anyone would've done the same. See you around, man... if the Zone is kind to us.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_most_leader_dialog_start_0">
    <text>Don't tell me we scared you? Come on over — we don't bite.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_most_leader_dialog_start_1_1">
    <text>Well, you know... was just walking by. Big exo guys walking around the Cordon...!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_most_leader_dialog_start_1_2">
    <text>Nah, guys. Maybe later.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_most_leader_dialog_start_2">
    <text>Nothing out of the ordinary. We got back from an incursion not long ago. This place is good for relaxing and resting up.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_most_leader_dialog_start_3">
    <text>Your gear sure is neat... So where exactly are you returning from?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_most_leader_dialog_start_4">
    <text>You won't believe it anyway, but we were at the Chornobyl power plant. Radiation there was sky-high, so we had to no choice but to head back the way we came. Something is hiding behind that radiation, and we're thinking about how to slip through to find out. Might be artifacts... who knows.\n \nThere actually used to be five of us: I'm Brute, and the boys by the fire are Gravedigger and Guerilla. The other two were Warhorse and Mute... rest their souls. The former took a Monolith bullet back at the power plant, and he collapsed right in the middle of a psy-field we were running from. If not for that, he might've still been alive... The latter went missing two months ago. He told us he was heading to the army warehouses on a scouting trip, and we haven't seen him since. That's two months we haven't heard anything from him. My best bet is that he kicked the bucket... but while Warhorse had no chance, we can't say anything about Mute for sure.\n \nIf you find him or his remains, let me know. It's important to us.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_most_leader_dialog_start_5">
    <text>Of course! What a story, too. How is the CNPP? Anything interesting there?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_most_leader_dialog_start_6">
    <text>Nope! You'd best steer clear of that place, pal. Beats the hell out of me what's waiting for you there — we lost one friend, and we sure as hell aren't going back to that hellish place to lose another...\n \nOn the other hand, there are artifacts there as far as the eye can see. The biggest threats there are the Monolith and the psy-emissions, but there are a few places where you can bypass them both as long as you have the right equipment. It sure would be a dream to do that..\n \nHey, you ever heard about the Wish Granter? They say it's some kind of glowing rock that apparently fulfills your wishes. It's supposed to be located in the heart of the Zone: in the CNPP, under the Sarcophagus. On one hand, it's a bunch of crap, but on the other, what else could the Monolith guys be guarding? That means there's still a reason to check in there. Who might you be yourself, by the way?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_most_leader_dialog_start_7">
    <text>Ah, I go by "Axe." Nice to meet you. I also want to see the CNPP — must be full of artifacts despite the dangers! I've heard about that Wish Granter... Even though I don't really believe in it, I have the wish to be there! Alright, sorry for all the questions... it's just that hardened stalkers like you aren't around every corner. Thanks for the info. It was nice talking to you.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_most_leader_dialog_start_8">
    <text>Just keep in mind, Axe, that whenever you feel like it, come to us and we'll find some decent work for you.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_most_leader_dialog_start_9">
    <text>Absolutely. Thanks again.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_most_leader_def_dialog_phrase">
    <text>Oh, hey, Axe. You here on business, or?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_start_0">
    <text>This area is off limits, stalker.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_start_1">
    <text>But I need to go there.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_start_2">
    <text>Tough luck. Unless you *really* need to go, then the price is five hundred.</text>

    <text>Here you are.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_start_3_2">
    <text>I don't have that kind of money.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_start_4_1">
    <text>Now listen up. We'll pretend for a moment it's nothing but mosquitoes and butterflies around here. What happens beyond this point is your own damn business.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_start_4_2">
    <text>Then go back where you came from and get it. And don't you try and sneak past us, you hear? Trust me, it's not worth dying for.</text>

  <string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_start_5_1">
    <text>I understand. Thank you, commander.</text>

    <text>I'm not looking for trouble, commander. Here's the money.</text>

    <text>Hi there! Is the coast clear?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_novice_dialog_1">
    <text>Hey! What can I tell you... Military's surveilling the area non-stop. Best not make any noise.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_novice_dialog_2">
    <text>You're right about that. I almost walked right into them the day before. Barely got out.</text>

  <string id="esc_village_novice_dialog_3">
    <text>You got lucky.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_novice_dialog_4">
    <text>So do you always keep watch here?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_novice_dialog_5">
    <text>No, we take turns. You want in?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_novice_dialog_6">
    <text>I'd rather not right now. Got enough work as it is. What about you? You didn't come to the Zone to just guard this place, did you?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_novice_dialog_7">
    <text>Of course not. I'll earn some money and experience, and then I'll give my shot at traveling into the Zone. I'm just dreaming to see the CNPP with my own eyes... Just thinking about it takes my breath away!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_novice_dialog_8">
    <text>Never been there myself either. I'd also want to go there.</text>

    <text>I mostly wander around the Cordon with my guys. We used to set up camp by the bridge and rest there, but now the military's back, so it's a bit harder these days. Passerbys have two options: pay the military or go through the tunnel with the anomalies. Neither one is really that compelling, so we're staying here for the moment.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_actor_story_dialog_2">
    <text>I see. You been beyond the Cordon? What do you think about those areas?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_actor_story_dialog_3">
    <text>A few times. Sidorovich once sent me to deliver artifacts to the scientists at Agroprom. He paid well, and I had a nice little chat with the scientific figures... I never got bored, so to speak. Still, it's better not to go to those parts without a reason, because you can end up in the wrong place, catch a stray bullet or run into any of the Zone's many creations...</text>

    <text>What creations?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_actor_story_dialog_5">
    <text>Hell, I don't even know what to tell you! A partner told me there's some weird stuff going on at the Duty outpost: some mystical entity appears before them at night. I don't believe in such stories, but when you hear such things from the horse's mouth, it's hard to even describe the feeling... All kinds of thoughts start storming you about what it could be.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_actor_story_dialog_6_1">
    <text>Probably just tall tales, but who knows. If I go there, I'll make sure to ask.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_actor_story_dialog_6_2">
    <text>They're not just stories. I was their at their outpost, and there's definitely some oddity there. The entity itself is harmless and appears when everyone's headed off at night.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_actor_story_dialog_7_1">
    <text>Up to you whether you believe it or not. I'm just telling you what I've heard.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_actor_story_dialog_7_2">
    <text>Well, now! I should stop going on excursions. The Cordon's got a balance to it: there's not much money, but you're not likely to die or lose your brains.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_actor_story_dialog_8_1">
    <text>I'll keep it in mind.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_actor_story_dialog_8_2">
    <text>You're right about that. I'm going now — had enough stories for today. Bye.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_start_dialog_0">
    <text>Hey there! I heard you were planning to cross the embankment. Could you help me with something?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_start_dialog_1">
    <text>What's it about?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_start_dialog_2">
    <text>A friend of mine, Kiryukha, went looking for loot on the other side and went missing. I don't know what might've happened to him... I hope he just found something useful and went to the Bar to make money off of it — he's like that. If you happen to find him on the way, let me know, 'kay?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_start_dialog_3">
    <text>I can't promise you anything, but I'll tell you if I see him.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_0">
    <text>Find anything out about Kiryukha?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_1">
    <text>Not yet.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_2">
    <text>I'm sorry, but your Kiryukha's dead...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_3">
    <text>How? What happened?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_4">
    <text>Before his last breath, he told me he was tricked to the abandoned grain elevator by a talking flesh. I fell for it too, and barely dealt with it. Good thing there was only one... but behind the embankment, in the lowlands, there's a whole pack of them. See where I'm going?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_5">
    <text>What? What do you mean?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_6">
    <text>I mean that a number of our boys have fallen to those scum — there's a whole heap of bodies at the grain elevator. If we don't take them out, sooner or later, they'll head to the village. You get me? We need to tell Fanatic about this.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_7">
    <text>He's on a trip with a few stalkers. Said he'd be back in a couple of days.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_8">
    <text>So that means we'll do this without him. I imagine they'll be attacking the camp anytime now. Got any men who can help?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_9">
    <text>I think so, yeah. They all knew Kiryukha. They won't turn us down.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_10_1">
    <text>Alright. That means we're going. Kiryukha said he saw them by the embankment, though I don't know how many there are. Godspeed!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_10_2">
    <text>Alright. That means we'll go in the morning. Kiryukha said he saw them by the embankment, though I don't know how many there are. Godspeed!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_11">
    <text>I'll take a moment to prepare, then we'll go.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_2_0">
    <text>Ready? Can't wait to take revenge on those things.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_2_1">
    <text>Yeah. Let's go.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_2_2">
    <text>Not yet. Wait a moment.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_task_for_trailer_shaiba_final_dialog_0">
    <text>Shit, man... Can't believe we got this far. Any more and I would've messed myself. You doing okay? We need to go back to the village, tell everyone the beasts are done with... and give our boys a burial while we're at it.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_task_for_trailer_shaiba_final_dialog_1">
    <text>This is some real vague shit... Let's go back to the village.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_task_for_trailer_shaiba_final_village_dialog_0">
    <text>Okay, we're here. Time to rest up from what we just went through... Thanks a lot for the help, stalker. If it wasn't for you, I would've remained there... This is yours now.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_task_for_trailer_shaiba_final_village_dialog_1">
    <text>Thanks. Don't let it get to you.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_fanat_dialog_questions_0">
    <text>I wanted to ask you a couple of questions.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_fanat_dialog_questions_1">
    <text>Shoot.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_fanat_dialog_questions_2">
    <text>How about some other time?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_fanat_dialog_burnt_home_0">
    <text>I see there's one less house in the village. How did it get burned down? I spent a few nights in it last year, and now all that's left to hang around in is the dull basement.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_fanat_dialog_burnt_home_1">
    <text>Best you don't ask. A few guys and I had to leave for a couple of days while the rest stayed here. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and trusted them not to make any trouble... but I was wrong. Those bastards lit a campfire in front of the house, and by evening, they were all drunk and out of control. I don't know the details, but the house burned down by nighttime. Good thing the army didn't catch up — the smoke must've been invisible in the dark. You wouldn't believe the stench all over the village when I got back... I thought I'd die right then and there just from breathing it. Now there's no way I'm leaving for that long — who knows what these daredevils will come up with?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_fanat_dialog_burnt_home_2">
    <text>Well, that's one hell of a story. Is there really no one here to keep order besides you?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_fanat_dialog_burnt_home_3">
    <text>I wish... I look at those slinks and they all keep quiet. I ask, "Who burned down the house?" They say, "We all did it." Try giving them your trust after that.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_fanat_dialog_burnt_home_4">
    <text>What a tight community. Everybody takes responsibility. The fellowship of the Zone!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_fanat_dialog_burnt_home_5">
    <text>One wish to rule them all... Okay, fellow, you go do your thing.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_start_0">
    <text>Hey there. I recently became the new owner of this little device, but it's in quite a sorry state. Could you take a look at it?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_start_1">
    <text>A 5.45 Groza? Now, *this* is a rare sample... Where did you get this thing? I've only ever seen it in enemy hands, and here you are bringing me one... a unique sample, too! Even if it's my first time with this gun, with a bottle, I'll make it do wonders in a couple days. Though, nothing in this world is free, you know?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_start_2">
    <text>How much?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_start_3">
    <text>No, money's not what I need right now. Got enough of it that I don't even know how to spend. Rather, I need a few work materials. I had a stalker that used to bring me those — Seryoga Koncheklyga — but he went missing about a week ago. According to him, you can get everything at the Garbage in some underground vault under the hangar. You've already seen those places, so take a look there and bring me everything you find.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_start_4_1">
    <text>Do I have a choice?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_start_4_2_1">
    <text>What a coincidence — I've already been there. Looks like I wasn't carrying around this stuff for nothing. Will this do?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_start_4_2_2">
    <text>What a coincidence — I've already been there. Looks like I wasn't carrying around this stuff for nothing. Will this do? Oh, and I found that stalker too. Dead... He's in the Electro in the woods.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_start_5_1">
    <text>I don't think so. But if you don't really need the gun, I could buy it off you for three and a half. Don't look at me like that... This piece is trashed.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_start_5_2_1">
    <text>Well, now! Just what I need. Okay, you can leave your piece here — I'll have it done in a day or two. I'll message you.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_start_5_2_2">
    <text>Damn... Thanks for telling me. Here I was thinking he'd given up on my request. Now, about the stuff... Okay, this is just what I need! You can leave your piece here — I'll have it done in a day or two. I'll message you.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_start_6_1_1">
    <text>No, that's too cheap. I'll get the materials for you.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_start_6_1_2">
    <text>Don't feel like running around and digging up junk for you. Take the thing.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_start_6_2">
    <text>Great! I'll be waiting. Talk to you soon.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_start_7_1">
    <text>Leave that half-gun here while it's out of killing condition and head to where we've agreed. I'll do everything properly.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_start_7_2">
    <text>Okay, here's your money. Good luck in the Zone.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_start_8_1">
    <text>Careful so you don't break it for good. I'll be back soon.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_start_8_2">
    <text>See you.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_final_0">
    <text>So, did you fix it?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_final_1">
    <text>It sure wasn't easy, but I did it. Here you go. Now, about our deal... Where are the materials I asked for?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_final_2_1">
    <text>Here's your junk. My whole backpack stinks from having to lug it around.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_final_2_2">
    <text>Here's your junk. My whole backpack stinks from having to lug it around. Oh, and I found your stalker... Looks like the poor guy wandered into an Electro in the woods.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_final_3_1">
    <text>Okay... just what I need. Here's your gun — you won't find anything like in the Zone, trust me. I even tried it out on some of the dogs, and it's a killing machine.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_final_3_2">
    <text>Damn! What happened, did he run into any of the mutants or roll around with a bullet in his head? Ugh, whatever... Here's your gun — you won't find anything like in the Zone, trust me. I even tried it out on some of the dogs, and it's a killing machine.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_final_4">
    <text>Thanks a lot. This might even get me to the center of the Zone!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_final_5">
    <text>Yeah. Wasn't easy, but I managed it in one afternoon. Take it.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_start_dialog_0">
    <text>Look who it is! And without an escort, too!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_start_dialog_1">
    <text>Hey, man! Haven't seen you in a while.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_start_dialog_2">
    <text>And here I thought our Axe was gone for good over there. So tell me, how's life beyond the Cordon?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_start_dialog_3">
    <text>Coming back here is like going on vacation. There's so much happening there. Everything's different...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_start_dialog_4_1">
    <text>Told you! You could've just stayed here and not bust your balls. Though I see you've got a new suit. You're coming up in the Zone!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_start_dialog_4_2">
    <text>Told you! You could've just stayed here and not bust your balls. And your suit's all battered — looks like you haven't come up in the Zone quite yet!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_start_dialog_4_3">
    <text>Told you! You could've just stayed here and not bust your balls. You don't even carry a suit anymore — something happen to you, little Axie?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_start_dialog_5_1">
    <text>Yeah, right! Crawling into anomalies...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_start_dialog_5_2">
    <text>I'll get a decent suit. Don't worry.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_start_dialog_5_3">
    <text>I'll have a decent suit sooner or later. Don't you worry about it.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_start_dialog_6">
    <text>Man, I would've loved to chat with you, but we have a little problem. You've got some experience under your belt now — I was hoping you could help.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_start_dialog_7">
    <text>What's it about?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_start_dialog_8_1">
    <text>Go see Fanatic. He'll tell you.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_start_dialog_8_2">
    <text>Go see Fanatic. He'll tell you. Oh, almost forgot! Here's your pay for the soldier.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_start_dialog_9_1">
    <text>Okay.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_start_dialog_9_2">
    <text>Great, thanks! I'll go talk to Fanatic.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_0">
    <text>Hey there!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_1">
    <text>Yurok told me something happened.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_2">
    <text>That's right. We sighted a mercenary group not far from here. Heck knows what they're looking for, but they've been stationed there for two days now, and I don't like it. They even tried taking over our camp once, but it didn't work out for them... thanks to this one stalker who helped us.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_3">
    <text>Best we don't stir up the hornet's nest, huh? They're just standing around.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_4">
    <text>That's exactly the thing — they're not just standing around. Three stalkers from the village broke camp where they decided to position themselves. They were coming back from a trip with loot and decided to sit by the fire and have a meal. Then the mercs showed up and opened fire before we even opened our mouth. Only one of them got away, and he barely made it to the village with his wounds.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_5">
    <text>Did he survive?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_6">
    <text>Unfortunately, no. But the last thing he told me was that the mercs were dead serious about their business. The whole village is on alert — everyone's too afraid to leave. We need to do something. We don't know how long they're planning on staying here or what their plans are, and while they're here, we're not safe.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_7">
    <text>What do you suggest?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_8">
    <text>I suggest we use the element of surprise and attack them. There are only five of them. If we head up to their camp quietly, we could easily drop 'em. I have no one else to take with me on this mission — it's just me and Yurok. The other greenhorns won't go even if you hold a gun at them.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_9">
    <text>The three of us against a mercenary camp? Sounds dangerous.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_10">
    <text>If we bring the rookies, we're shooting ourselves in the foot. We have two advantages on our side: the element of surprise and a rocket launcher that some stalkers just stole from the army. We'll approach quietly and make blast those bastards. I have past experience with this — a group of mercenaries wanted to throw us out before, but we stood our ground.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_11">
    <text>You never change. Any problem comes up, you deal with it the explosive way.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_12">
    <text>The only way to do it! Are you with us?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_13">
    <text>Of course I'm with you. No way I'd leave you hanging. What's the plan?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_14">
    <text>We wait for sunrise and move out.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_15">
    <text>Understood.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_attack_ready_dialog_0">
    <text>Ready?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_attack_ready_dialog_1">
    <text>Ready. Let's head out.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_attack_relax_dialog_0">
    <text>I don't like this..</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_attack_relax_dialog_1">
    <text>Where'd they go?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_attack_relax_dialog_2">
    <text>No idea.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_attack_relax_dialog_3">
    <text>Maybe they're dug in below ground somewhere?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_attack_relax_dialog_4">
    <text>I don't see anything on the ground. What I did see was a bright flash.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_attack_relax_dialog_5">
    <text>What are we gonna do?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_attack_relax_dialog_6">
    <text>The only thing we can do: get back to camp. I don't know who these people are and where they disappeared, but I'm getting the creeps from this place. Let's just bury the guys along the way first instead of leaving them here.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_attack_relax_dialog_7">
    <text>Let's go...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_second_dialog_0">
    <text>Well, that's how it goes. I hope they won't show up anymore. Still, Sidorovich needs to know of this — he'll think of something if his own skin is at stake.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_second_dialog_1">
    <text>If anything else comes up, let me know. I'll always help my old friends.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_second_dialog_2">
    <text>You stay in touch too! Thanks for the help. We owe you one. Where are you headed?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_second_dialog_3">
    <text>To Novoshepelychi. Got a job there. I actually came here to find out about a route leading to that place, and I had a free moment turn up just now. What can you tell me?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_second_dialog_4">
    <text>It's an interesting place — I've been there a few times. The route to it is located near the mutant lair you and Fanatic blew up. Take a right turn and you'll end up at the collapsed railway tunnel, where you can go down and enter Novoshepelychi. Once you plan on coming back, don't bother going through the same route you came in — take the underground service tunnel instead. Once you're at the Cordon, go out through the door. For some reason, it's locked from the outside, which is why you have to take different paths. Now, be careful... The Garbage doesn't even compare in terms of danger.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_second_dialog_5">
    <text>Thanks. Good luck to you here. I'll meet up with you soon!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mid_final_mercs_merc_leader_start_dialog_0">
    <text>We meet again.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mid_final_mercs_merc_leader_start_dialog_1">
    <text>You son of a bitch. You opened fire! I had no use for your damn artifact!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mid_final_mercs_merc_leader_start_dialog_2">
    <text>I don't see it in your backpack. Where is it?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mid_final_mercs_merc_leader_start_dialog_3">
    <text>If I tell you, how will I know you'll let me go?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mid_final_mercs_merc_leader_start_dialog_4">
    <text>We're good guys when listened to and when we're understood the first time. So we'll do it like this: you tell us the place you hid the goods, we grab it, and you continue your own path. What was it you were doing again? Shooting mutants? Gathering artifacts? That's exactly what you'll keep doing, like nothing happened.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mid_final_mercs_merc_leader_start_dialog_5">
    <text>I'll only tell you when I'm in safety, far from here. You told me yourself what you're capable of. If I lie, you'll find me anyway.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_1_start_dialog_0">
    <text>Buddy, try digging up something here. I've got no luck. Either I'm doing something wrong or my detector's broke...</text>
  </string>

    <text>Need anything, brother?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_fanat_mishgan_pda_dialog_0">
    <text>I found the body of a stalker at the Garbage. His name was Mishgan. Here's a note he had on him. He asked me to take his PDA to the rookie village.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_fanat_mishgan_pda_dialog_1">
    <text>Shit... Mishgan! I told him to stay out of that damn Garbage! How'd it happen?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_fanat_mishgan_pda_dialog_2_1">
    <text>He needed help freeing his comrades from bandits. Our odds weren't great, so I turned him down. Mishgan whacked me in the head and went off on his own... When I woke up, I found three bodies at the vehicle graveyard: it was him and two of his friends. The bandits were gone by then.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_fanat_mishgan_pda_dialog_2_2">
    <text>No idea.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_fanat_mishgan_pda_dialog_3_1">
    <text>I didn't expect you to let down a fellow stalker! With your help, he would've freed his friends and everyone would've come out alive. You really chickened out?... Yeah, that stuff ain't like doing errands for Sid at the Cordon...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_fanat_mishgan_pda_dialog_3_2">
    <text>Real shame about him. He was a good comrade for everyone the village. Now he'll be rotting with all the garbage...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_fanat_mishgan_pda_dialog_4_1">
    <text>Well, that's how things happened.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_fanat_mishgan_pda_dialog_4_2">
    <text>I'm sorry about it.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_fanat_mishgan_pda_dialog_5">
    <text>Either way, thanks for telling us. Here are some spare supplies I've got. You could use it.</text>

    <text>Thanks. Until next time.</text>

  <string id="esc_trader_second_job_dialog_start_0">
    <text>Hey! Got any missions?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_second_job_dialog_start_1_1">
    <text>Hello there! I do. I'd say you've performed well, so I hope I won't regret trusting you with this task...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_second_job_dialog_start_1_2">
    <text>Hello there. Something's been coming up: the army and scientists were supposed to carry out some field research here at the Cordon. I wanted to ask you to see where they go, but they were having some problems at the checkpoints... a shootout of some kind. So right now I can only offer you small-time work.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_second_job_dialog_start_2">
    <text>I'm all ears.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_second_job_dialog_start_3_1">
    <text>There's a scientist team that's soon arriving at the military checkpoint. I don't know what the hell they're after, but I do know that they're about to depart with a military escort to do some field research.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_second_job_dialog_start_3_2">
    <text>This one stalker, Puck, sent me a message not long ago. Not far away from here, by the Electro tunnel, there's a lot of mutant scum that needs cleaning out. Will you do it?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_second_job_dialog_start_4_1">
    <text>What field research?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_second_job_dialog_start_4_2_1">
    <text>Of course. Need to earn cash somehow. I'm not planning on staying at the Cordon.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_second_job_dialog_start_4_2_2">
    <text>There's nothing there. I literally just cleaned the place out.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_second_job_dialog_start_5_1">
    <text>That's what I want to find out. Maybe they're cooking something up against the stalkers, and that means my business will take a hit. I need to know everything. You'll be tracking them, but be careful about it. See where they go and what they'll be doing, then report to me. Now, get moving! We'll settle up later.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_second_job_dialog_start_5_2_1">
    <text>Then get to work. Make sure you clean out every single beast.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_second_job_dialog_start_5_2_2">
    <text>Great work, then. Here's your reward. You're free to go — I have nothing more to offer you.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_second_job_dialog_start_6_1">
    <text>Got it. I'll do the best I can.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_second_job_dialog_start_6_2">
    <text>Thanks. And goodbye, Sid.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_scientists_jobs_cancel_dialog_0">
    <text>Sid, things have happened... Basically, all field research was canceled, and I barely made it away from the army alive.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_scientists_jobs_cancel_dialog_1">
    <text>What do you mean, canceled? That's good on the one hand... but on the other, your parents must be ashamed of you. Soon enough, they might come back and carry out their experiments, and you, of course, won't be at the Cordon by then. I'll have to find someone else.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_scientists_jobs_cancel_dialog_2">
    <text>Well, what can you do...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_scientists_jobs_cancel_dialog_3">
    <text>Here's for the delayed work. Door's right behind you.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_scientists_jobs_cancel_dialog_4">
    <text>Goodbye, Sid.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_scientists_fail_dialog_0">
    <text>Sid, the eggheads spotted me. I barely made it out alive. That field research will definitely be delayed for some time.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_scientists_fail_dialog_1">
    <text>If anyone finds out, you'll have some serious problems on your hands with your reputation. Don't expect me to trust you with anything more serious from now on.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_scientists_fail_dialog_2">
    <text>Just don't tell anyone about it, Sid. Let's say I dealt with any problems in advance that they would've caused it. C'mon, gimme a reward!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_scientists_fail_dialog_3">
    <text>You're quite bold, aren't you, stalker? A reward's not what you need... no, you need a good smack on the head. Now, get out.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_scientists_fail_dialog_4">
    <text>Bye, Sid...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_scientist_1_fail_dialog_0">
    <text>Don't shoot! What do you need?</text>

    <text>Any luck with it?</text>

  <string id="esc_village_technic_scientists_device_active_dialog_0">
    <text>Shit, the thing somehow has an impact on monsters! Help the guys fend off the attack — I'll turn off this junk!</text>

    <text>Yeah! Okay! I'm off!</text>

    <text>Did you fight 'em off?!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_technic_scientists_device_attack_compl_dialog_1">
    <text>We did! So, any luck in turning that thing off?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_technic_scientists_device_attack_compl_dialog_2">
    <text>Yeah, thank god. Barely managed!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_technic_scientists_device_attack_compl_dialog_3">
    <text>I don't know what it is, but that thing lured the mutants over here. As soon as you turned it off, they literally disappeared!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_technic_scientists_device_attack_compl_dialog_4">
    <text>Well now... Listen, I have no use for devices like this. How about this: you find a way to plant this thing by the bandits at the vehicle station and I give you a suit in return. What do you say about that? The stalkers and I will be grateful to you!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_technic_scientists_device_attack_compl_dialog_5">
    <text>Soon enough, I'm gonna need to leave the Cordon, so a new suit will be just right for me. Give me the device and I'll give it a shot.</text>

    <text>I planted the device there. Didn't think I was gonna get out alive...</text>

    <text>Good work, stalker. Here you go: a brand new stalker suit, as promised. Good luck outside of the Cordon. If you need anything fixed, you know who to turn to.</text>

    <text>I tracked down the scientists — they had a military escort. They arrived at the floating village by the vehicle station. One of them went through the teleporters to get to the top, and he planted some device there.</text>

    <text>What kind of device?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_scientists_task_good_dialog_1_2">
    <text>I got that by now. Why in the seven hells did you bring that thing to the village? You take me for a complete idiot? There's never been a single mutant attack like that here before!</text>

    <text>No idea.</text>

    <text>I've dealt with a lot of mongrels in my time, Axe, but out of all of them, you're the one that'll be remembered. Get out of my sight. This is for the work, but don't expect me to trust you with anything serious again.</text>

    <text>A stalker named Puck told me that the scientists and army arrived at the floating village by the vehicle station, and that one of the eggheads went through the teleporters to get to the top, where the house is. There, he installed some kind of device.</text>

    <text>I'm listening, Zhuravlyov.</text>

    <text>Have you seen the stalker on this photograph?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_army_base_soldier_leader_clothes_dialog_4">
    <text>I can tell you with certainty that he hasn't been among our detainees. So you've got a bone to pick with him — is that why you came to these parts? Did he do anything special?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_army_base_soldier_leader_clothes_dialog_5_1">
    <text>Not quite sure yet. I'll ask Sidorovich — maybe he can tell me something. I'll talk to your detainees about him too.</text>

    <text>Just be careful about your inquisitions, and above all, don't touch him. We need that man alive. Understood? You'd also be better off without military wear. There's a crate with clothing by the cells where the detainees are held — grab what you need from there and leave what you don't need. Just remember that some of it was taken from dead trespassers...

    <text>Talked to the prisoners?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_army_base_soldier_leader_clothes_second_dialog_0_2">
    <text>Talked to the prisoners? Does the clothing suit you alright?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_army_base_soldier_leader_clothes_second_dialog_1_1">
    <text>I haven't found out anything new, unfortunately. I'll go see Sidorovich.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_army_base_soldier_leader_clothes_second_dialog_1_2">
    <text>The clothing fits, thank you. As for the prisoners, I haven't found out anything new, so I'll go see Sidorovich.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_army_base_soldier_leader_clothes_second_dialog_2">
    <text>Just keep your ID with you so you don't get taken by our boys.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_army_base_soldier_leader_clothes_second_dialog_3">
    <text>Of course. What will we do about the detainees?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_army_base_soldier_leader_clothes_second_dialog_4">
    <text>What do you think? As per all laws of mother Ukraine, they'll end up in court... Actually, no! First they'll do some work for the benefit of our checkpoint — we need a fresh coat of paint for the garage and new plastering for the workshop. After that, we can have those boys deported. What, does your facility also need extra manpower?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_army_base_soldier_leader_clothes_second_dialog_5">
    <text>We need brains, not muscle. I might need this one stalker named Shimmer soon. Don't do anything rash to him.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_army_base_soldier_leader_clothes_second_dialog_6">
    <text>Noted. If he doesn't get high on paint, it'll be alright. But remember: you have two days. After that, they'll be escorted to the outside.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_army_base_soldier_leader_clothes_second_dialog_7">
    <text>Understood. Thank you, captain.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_0">
    <text>What do you want?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_1">
    <text>Just dropped by for supplies and to trade for info.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_2">
    <text>What makes you think I'll share any of that with you? I don't remember you from here.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_3">
    <text>What else is there to do here? These areas are mapped out down to the last inch. The north, on the other hand... that's where I want to go.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_4_1">
    <text>Judging by your wear, your "north" goes as far as the pig farm by the bridge. Hah!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_4_2">
    <text>Still, I don't know anything about you. To tell you the truth, I wouldn't want to, either.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_5_1">
    <text>Wouldn't want to stain my exo in the Cordon mud... and your rookies might turn into drooling fools.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_5_2">
    <text>Can we quit being snarky and talk like normal people?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_6_1">
    <text>Fair point! So, what do you want?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_6_2">
    <text>Alright. What do you need?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_7">
    <text>I need information on a stalker. I take it that's the most valuable currency here, so I have something to offer in return.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_8">
    <text>Yeah? And what might that be?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_9">
    <text>Does information on Yantar interest you?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_10">
    <text>Not at all! I've sent three teams there, and not a single one has come back alive!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_11">
    <text>If I offer you a detailed map of the vicinity, the chance of your next team returning will be higher... and there might be profit in it for you personally. Interested?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_12">
    <text>What would you like in return?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_13">
    <text>I'm looking for the stalker on this photo. He seems to go by "Axe." Know him?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_14">
    <text>Ah... Yeah, I know that face... Okay, hand me the map and I'll tell you where he is. But I don't know anything else about him, nor do I care. </text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_15">
    <text>And that means...? Is your information on his position accurate?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_16">
    <text>It is. Give me the map!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_17">
    <text>I'll send it on your PDA.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_18">
    <text>Suits me! So... You know about the collapsed railway bridge nearby, right?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_19">
    <text>Of course I have.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_20">
    <text>If you want to find him, that's where you want to go. And don't ask me about details. Better yet, you and I never had this conversation. Now, get going. Chop-chop.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_21">
    <text>Right, then. Have a nice day.</text>

    <text>What are you hanging around here for?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_1_dialog_1">
    <text>Just stopping by for Sidorovich. I need to see him.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_1_dialog_2">
    <text>So what are you waiting for? Just don't hang around here!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_1_dialog_3">
    <text>Understood.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_2_dialog_0">
    <text>Well, why are you walking around here?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_2_dialog_1">
    <text>Relax. I need to see Sidorovich on some business.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_2_dialog_2">
    <text>Then go see him. The bunker's behind you. Don't think of doing anything without our permission.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_2_dialog_3">
    <text>See you.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_3_dialog_0">
    <text>What do you need here?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_3_dialog_1">
    <text>I need to see Sidorovich on some business. Don't work yourself up.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_3_dialog_2">
    <text>Sidorovich is on the other side. Watch yourself while you're here.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_3_dialog_3">
    <text>Bye.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_1_angry_dialog_0">
    <text>Listen, pal. I don't care whoever you are in that getup of yours — you'd better stay away from here. We don't need people like you.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_1_angry_dialog_1">
    <text>Keep it quiet... I'm here to see Sidorovich.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_1_angry_dialog_2">
    <text>Don't even think about meeting Sidorovich — who knows what you've got planned... We've already messaged him, and if you try anything up here, you'll just get yourself shot.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_1_angry_dialog_3">
    <text>I see, then... Wait. If I can't see him, maybe you could tell me where to find the stalker on this photo?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_1_angry_dialog_4">
    <text>Wait, that's... Uh, no, I don't know him. Get going.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_1_angry_dialog_5">
    <text>Okay, then. Bye.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_2_angry_dialog_0">
    <text>Buddy, I don't know who think you are in those shoddy clothes, but I'm telling you: get out of here.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_2_angry_dialog_1">
    <text>Not so loud. I'm just here to see Sidorovich on business.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_2_angry_dialog_2">
    <text>You've no chance of seeing him — he's already been notified. Don't try anything around here... or we'll get your head straight one way or another.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_2_angry_dialog_3">
    <text>Hold up... If I can't see the trader, could you tell me where to find the stalker on this photo?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_2_angry_dialog_4">
    <text>Dunno anything 'bout him. Now, clear off while you still can.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_2_angry_dialog_5">
    <text>Bye, then.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_3_angry_dialog_0">
    <text>Man, you better get out of here with that shady getup of yours. We don't need folks like you.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_3_angry_dialog_1">
    <text>Let's not make any fuss. I'm here to see Sidorovich on business.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_3_angry_dialog_2">
    <text>You think that's gonna work? He doesn't let in people like you, that's for sure. He's been notified about your arrival, so deal with it and don't expect to see him.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_3_angry_dialog_3">
    <text>What the hell did you do that for? Then you be the one to help me out. Do you know the stalker on this photo?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohr_3_angry_dialog_4">
    <text>First time I see him. Go about your business — don't bother the locals.</text>
  </string>

    <text>Bye.</text>
  </string>

    <text>Hey, Axe. Want something?</text>

    <text>What've you got, Axe?</text>
  </string>

    <text>Well, I'm listening.</text>

    <text>Come to get your stuff fixed?</text>

    <text>What are you looking for, newcomer?</text>

  <string id="esc_fanat_after_yantar_idle_dialog_0_2">
    <text>And who have we got here?</text>
  </string>

    <text>What do you need?</text>
  </string>

    <text>What is it that you want? Go take a hike.</text>

    <text>Don't bother me.</text>

    <text>Don't get in my business, eh?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohrs_idle_dialog_0_4">
    <text>Would you kindly get lost?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohrs_idle_dialog_0_5">
    <text>Could you just not bother us?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohrs_idle_dialog_0_6">
    <text>Off with you. Don't bother us.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohrs_idle_dialog_0_7">
    <text>Beat it, buddy. Go find someplace else to wander about.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohrs_idle_dialog_0_8">
    <text>What else do you want? Go about your business.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohrs_idle_dialog_0_9">
    <text>Get moving. Don't bother us.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_after_yantar_ohrs_idle_dialog_0_10">
    <text>Go on, get out of here, and stay out of our way.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_composer_task_start_dialog_0">
    <text>Is there perhaps any work for me at the Garbage?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_composer_task_start_dialog_1">
    <text>There is. It's not your first day in the Zone, so you can handle it. Some of the boys at the Garbage need help with dealing with dogs and digging out some minor artifacts. All you have to do is cover their backs and they'll give you your cut when it's done.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_composer_task_start_dialog_2">
    <text>Got it. Give me the coordinates.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_0">
    <text>Need something, friend?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_1">
    <text>Why are you sitting here all alone?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_2">
    <text>I screwed up.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_3">
    <text>So bad they exiled you?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_4">
    <text>No. Just a stroke of idiocy.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_5">
    <text>Tell me what happened.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_6">
    <text>You don't know? I scared the shit out of everyone! One night, the boys were drinking and I decided to play a prank on them when they were spread around their camps. You probably the same thing back in pioneer camp, eh? I shouted across the whole village: "Pseudodogs! Pseudodogs are attacking!" Everyone went full alert and took up positions. I couldn't keep myself from laughing like an idiot. I told them it was just a joke. After that, they gave me such a beating I couldn't even say a word in the morning. Now, nobody even wants to talk to me. My new name? "Jester." I'm the only one who laughed at my own prank... and they no longer believe a word I say.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_7_1">
    <text>What do you have to say about it?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_7_2">
    <text>That's what you get. Do you even know where we are, you idiot? This is no place for jokes, and your prank was worse than any real pseudodog out there!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_8_1">
    <text>Whatever I say, nobody will care. Though... I did notice something through my binoculars when I was on a task from Sidorovich by the embankment.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_8_2">
    <text>I know... but nobody believes me anymore! Though, right after that, I noticed something through my binoculars when I was on a task from Sidorovich by the embankment.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_9">
    <text>What exactly?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_10">
    <text>An artifact. I haven't seen its kind before, and whoever I asked said they didn't know anything. I'm too afraid to go by myself, though... It's right by the pig farm, and as you know, that place is full of flesh. Nobody wants to go with me, and the elder just laughs it off when I tell him about it.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_11_1">
    <text>You want me to come?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_11_2">
    <text>I don't feel like going anywhere with you, so buh-bye.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_12">
    <text>You serious?! I wouldn't mind you covering my back — you seem a lot more experienced than anyone else in the camp. Wanna go now?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_13_1">
    <text>Sure. Let's go find your artifact.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_13_2">
    <text>Bit later. I need to do something.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_after_start_dialog_0">
    <text>You're back. What is it?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_after_start_dialog_1_1">
    <text>Want me to come with you for that artifact?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_after_start_dialog_1_2">
    <text>Just passing by.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_wait_dialog_0">
    <text>Ready to move?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_wait_dialog_1_1">
    <text>Yeah, let's go.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_wait_dialog_1_2">
    <text>Not yet.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_task_dialog_0">
    <text>Artifact's just around the corner. Ready?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_task_dialog_1">
    <text>Show the way.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_take_dialog_0">
    <text>Oh, that's rich... There really was a pack of pseudodogs here. Should've kept my mouth shut from the start! Let me at least look at the artifact.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_take_dialog_1_1">
    <text>Here, you earned it.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_take_dialog_1_2">
    <text>I'll take it for myself.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_take_dialog_2_1">
    <text>An interesting piece, for sure. I'm wondering about it's properties... I guess we should talk to Sidorovich about that. We heading back to camp?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_take_dialog_2_2">
    <text>Hey, that wasn't the deal! Have a heart and give it to me!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_take_dialog_3_1">
    <text>Yeah, let's go.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_take_dialog_3_2">
    <text>Piss off. The artifact is mine, and that's that.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_end_dialog_0">
    <text>Home, sweet home. I'll head into the camp to grab a few of my things and rest, then go to Sidorovich and sell them along with the artifact. Don't go too far — I'll contact you when I have a deal with him. You've earned half of the sum.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_end_dialog_1">
    <text>As you say. Just don't think about fooling me.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_end_dialog_2">
    <text>Why'd I do that? You're the first one to believe me after such a long time!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_end_dialog_3">
    <text>My advice to you, Jester, is to treat the other rookies to a drink and apologize to them.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_end_dialog_4">
    <text>Yeah, you're right. I'll treat them to something and apologize. Maybe they'll believe me after I tell them.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_end_dialog_5">
    <text>Good. Talk to you soon.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_reward_dialog_0">
    <text>There's my man! Here's your reward for the whole ordeal. Thanks again!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_reward_dialog_1">
    <text>Thanks, Jester... if they still call you that.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_reward_dialog_2">
    <text>Don't worry 'bout it. It kind of stuck to me. Still, things are all good between me and the rest, as you can see. Wanna stay with us, maybe share a few tales?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_reward_dialog_3">
    <text>Sorry, but it's time for me. Good luck, stalker... I hope you've learned your lesson.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_idle_dialog_0_1">
    <text>Good to see you!</text>

    <text>Later.</text>

    <text>I think you have a story to tell.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_bandit_savior_army_base_dialog_2">
    <text>Yes, I do. My name is Alexey Kucherenko and it so happens that I work undercover in the Zone, infiltrating different groups, finding out all kinds of information about everything that happens in the Zone. I know... quite a bit. That's all I can say about myself. You know what I mean!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_bandit_savior_army_base_dialog_3">
    <text>So you're a military. Then let's get to know each other properly, I'll...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_bandit_savior_army_base_dialog_4">
    <text>I already know who you are. No, I'm not a military, but I co-operate with them on various issues as well. Let's just say that some people in the Zone know who I am other than the real Cluster kid, these people are few, but they are very useful people.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_bandit_savior_army_base_dialog_5">
    <text>Well, if that's the case, then you know what's really going on and you can tell me.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_bandit_savior_army_base_dialog_6">
    <text>Well, I do know some things, but I can't tell you much. And believe me, you live longer with less. Information... it can hurt...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_bandit_savior_army_base_dialog_7">
    <text>All right, well, tell me something so it's not so vague, and where's Birdie?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_bandit_savior_army_base_dialog_8">
    <text>About Birdie. Hmm. Well, I don't trust him all that much. As for the whole cargo thing, it's simple. There were two, maybe not brilliant, but quite clever scientists working on a psy emitter in the Zone. We've already talked to both of them in one way or another. But, as usual, one has goals, so to speak, for the good of mankind, and the other has... a more scientific interest. I'm doing my job, and as long as it matches your goals, we're partners.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_bandit_savior_army_base_dialog_9">
    <text>Let me guess, when the goals don't align, you're gonna killed me?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_bandit_savior_army_base_dialog_10">
    <text>What?! The military stuff doesn't apply to me. I meant we'll go our separate ways. And yes, let Birdie keep thinking Cluster is a real kid from the big road. </text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_bandit_savior_army_base_dialog_11">
    <text>By the way, why a bandit?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_bandit_savior_army_base_dialog_12">
    <text>That's because so few people take it seriously. It's good to be underestimated! So, today I'm Cluster the bandit, and tomorrow someone else. Don't worry your head. Go to Smyshlov's, I'll come later, they haven't agreed with Birdie yet.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_bandit_savior_army_base_dialog_13">
    <text>I'll ask you to open the door of this cage first.</text>

    <text>Just a moment. But be warned, if you come here again, I may not be around.</text>

    <text>Yes, sir.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_0">
    <text>Well, hello, stalker. Glad to see you're alive and well! Where's the device?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_1">
    <text>I'm sick of you people asking the same question... at least now you have an answer. Turov has it. Understand? He set his people on us. And they took it away.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_2">
    <text>What?!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_3">
    <text>I've had a lot of people die because of this thing, and I almost met the same fate as them a few times. What am I to you, some delivery boy? Jesus, one's asking for some device, the other's asking for a bunch of papers... At least thanks for not pointing a gun at the back of my head! You're supposed to be men of science — the light of truth and all that, but you're like little children, you can't come to an agreement! What do you want?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_4">
    <text>I can see you want answers... Alright then, let's start in order. When I was in my third year, I met Turov and...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_5">
    <text>Professor, I don't want a retelling of your memoirs, I'm not a book publisher!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_6_1">
    <text>Okay, okay, I'll try to keep it short. Some time ago, me and my ex-colleague Turov planned to put our scientific concepts and hypnoses into practice. The Exclusion Zone was just what we were looking for — a treasure trove of all kinds of subjects, with which we could get proper recognition from our colleagues and maybe even earn a Nobel Prize for studying the properties of the Zone's nature, as well as its anomalies, flora and fauna! But most of all we were interested in the what we call "psy-radiation", the nature of which still remains a complete mystery for us to this day. At the time, I thought we were planning on building a portable psy-emitter for therapeutic purposes. We wanted to cure those unfortunates whose brains had stopped functioning properly after exposure to psy-radiation. After a long design process, we had finally built a mobile prototype psy-emitter.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_6_2">
    <text>Go on.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_6_3">
    <text>Its task was not only to protect us from the Zone's psy-radiation, but like I said, to also have a therapeutic effect on zombified individuals. We had also planned to adapt our psy-emitter for medical purposes outside the Exclusion Zone. The prototype we made could not only generate psy-radiation, but also change its nature and adjust the power of flow. Unfortunately, the more time went on, the more Turov started disagreeing with me on so many aspects of the project, and on how to apply the prototype. His interest was less humanitarian. Most of all, Turov was trying to find out how to use the transmitter to control the consciousness of not only animals and mutants, but also humans. After that, I stopped cooperating with him for good.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_7">
    <text>So your psy-device can be good or bad? It's just a matter of who uses it?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_8">
    <text>Luckly, or unluckly — yes, that's exactly how it is. You just can't divide the world into good and bad! That's not how it works!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_9">
    <text>I see. But you're one of them, aren't you? Why can't you both strike some sort of deal?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_10">
    <text>Do I have to?... Let me guess: Turov told you about the incident I had during the tests and that I'm really paranoid now? And then, probably, he told you that because of my paranoia I suspected a decent scientist, who stands for science and enlightenment and absolutely nothing more — of using a psy-emitter for manipulation and for his own selfish purposes? Oh, and that he sending you to get my documents so that he could finally have a chance to cure me, right?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_11">
    <text>Well... give or take, yeah.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_12">
    <text>You see, I was indeed hit by the radiation, but it had no negative effect on me. Quite the opposite. I'm as calm as I've ever been. And it was a two-way mental link. But still I had an obsessive thought about Turov not after the radiation, but when he began to spend more time on experiments on controlling the consciousness of living and non-living beings. Time goes by, and those who were exposed to the Brain Scorcher radiation are not getting younger either, and I think that they should be helped first of all. Turov, of course, explained his actions as creating a special stream of radiation to protect against monster attacks, so that the scientists could safely move around the Zone. Think about what I said!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_13">
    <text>Isn't it bad for every person in the Zone to have a device?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_14">
    <text>Of course it's good! Do you know what the dynamite was originally created for? That's just it, inventions can always be used for good purposes or vice versa, whether directly or indirectly. History knows many such examples. And our psy device will affect both monsters and humans, that's the problem! What happens if you are forced to go to the most dangerous places of the Zone against your will? Is it a good thing when you or any other person can be controlled with buttons and toggle switches? Do you want to be a puppet of an unknown puppeteer?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_15">
    <text>Are you guys out of your minds? Why are you doing this kind of development? You want to be a god?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_16">
    <text>You have no idea how much can be achieved! For me, this development was worth a lot, too much!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_17">
    <text>I don't care what she cost you!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_18">
    <text>You don't understand... this is my life's work.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_19">
    <text>Professor, listen to yourself! Turov has your device, the whole thing! I just don't understand why he needs your documents.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_20">
    <text>It's simple, the device is unstable even at short distances. And in order for it to work stably at a distance of several kilometres and not to lose power every five minutes, the core must be reinforced. And only I know how to do it.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_21">
    <text>To hell with you! And Turov and your device!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_22">
    <text>I understand. But you can't undo what you've done, and now you have to deal with the consequences. So give me some time to think this through. In the meantime, go to Sidorovich and get some psy-blockers. Tell him I sent you.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_23">
    <text>All right, Professor, just remember that without the papers we'll be killed, and maybe you too.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_trader_psy_blockade_dialog_0">
    <text>Hey, Sid. The professor sent me here to fetch some meds.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_trader_psy_blockade_dialog_1">
    <text>What kind of meds?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_trader_psy_blockade_dialog_2">
    <text>Psy-blockers, several of them.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_trader_psy_blockade_dialog_3">
    <text>Here you go, if that's the way it is. God forbid if something comes to the village again because of you — I'll get up and personally kick your ass if it does. Once was already enough.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_trader_psy_blockade_dialog_4">
    <text>Don't panic, old man, everything's under control. Take care.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_00">
    <text>So, do you have the psy-blockers?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_01_1">
    <text>Yeah, I got them, here you go.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_01_2">
    <text>Not yet, I'm heading to the trader.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_02">
    <text>Keep a couple of them. Might come in handy in the future.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_03">
    <text>Thank you. I'm about to be hunted down by Turov's mate. So now would be a good time to tell me your plan.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_1">
    <text>I've given it a lot of thought. I won't give him the documents.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_2">
    <text>Professor, you know my situation. So if you don't give me the documents, I'll have to take them from you by force!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_3">
    <text>It won't be necessary. I'll go with you to see Turov.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_4">
    <text>We-e-ll... what are you up to?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_5">
    <text>Talking to an old colleague and friend. I want to talk some sense into him...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_6">
    <text>Professor, there must be something you're not telling me. You know that Turov can talk you out of this either with a gun or with your mobile emitter! Tell me directly what you want to do.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_7">
    <text>It's very simple, look at this. The core isn't just a screw, it's the brain of a living being that's been subjected to psi-influence. Or rather, a creature that died from a psy effect. So, depending on who the creature was when it was alive, the device operates on a certain spectrum of psy radiation. And that affects not only the strength and range of the effects, but also the...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_8">
    <text>Professor, we're stalkers, we're not scientists, we don't understand you!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_9">
    <text>Then why did you ask?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_10">
    <text>I was asking for your plan of action, not how your piece of metal works...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_11">
    <text>It's not a piece of metal! It's almost a living being, capable of releasing, amplifying and channelling its psy-energy to the right organisms with the help of the device!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_12">
    <text>Um... What do you have, a pocket Controller in there?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_13">
    <text>Well, if you want to simplify it, so be it, but it's not a Controller. The point is that this creature is empathically aware of what's going on around it, but it's not fully trained, it doesn't understand what's "good" and what's "bad"!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_14">
    <text>So that's it... So this pocket one of yours, what's his name, is lying in a a glass cartridge and while the power is not connected, it sleeps, right? And when it's powered up, it stays awake and kills everyone around it? Like those stalker and mercenaries?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_15">
    <text>Yes and no! A group of stalkers carrying a container were attacked by mutants. People were experiencing fear, pain, shock, and other negative emotions. Now, the creature in the container understands all of these emotions and experiences them. This range of emotions traumatises it. So in order to protect itself, it took control of part of the group of stalkers and eliminated them.... and the rest ran away with the container, believing that the controller was nearby!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_16">
    <text>What a poetic ending... Killed by a mini-mutant in a container while defending from mutants...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_17">
    <text>No, I mean yes, but no!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_18">
    <text>Okay. Let's summarise. One of the three boxes contains a brain that can do things with psy radiation. I take it that's the core, right? And if that's the case, what can you change about it, this brain?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_19">
    <text>You asked for no details! Give me the radio, I'll talk to Turov.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_20">
    <text>Hurry up, please.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_final_dialog_0">
    <text>Exactly.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_final_dialog_1">
    <text>So what now?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_final_dialog_2">
    <text>Now let's go visit! I'll just grab a few things. And yes, we're leaving a few minutes apart. I'll go first, then you come out after me.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_final_dialog_3">
    <text>Come on, old man, come on. You'll never make it alone. All you know how to do is sit in your concrete boxes and poke at microscopes with tweezers! Do you even have a detector and a dosimeter?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_final_dialog_4">
    <text>I don't need detectors after the radiation I've received. I can feel them, the traps of the Zone. But I'll bring my machine gun.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_final_dialog_5">
    <text>I wouldn't mind some of that exposure too, cool! Anyway, old man, wait. We're not letting you go alone!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_final_dialog_6">
    <text>Why is that?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_final_dialog_7">
    <text>What if you decide to run away and we have to deal with Turov and Vizir. And I think they'll give us such lead pills that we'll be in trouble.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_final_dialog_8">
    <text>Don't worry, I'm a decent person and I keep my word!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_final_dialog_9">
    <text>Honesty is a good thing, but in the Zone it's a very vague concept. Let's go together, we'll protect you from all sorts of beasts, from four-legged and worse.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_final_dialog_10">
    <text>All right, have it your way.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_final_dialog_11_1">
    <text>That's the deal. Let's go.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_final_dialog_11_2">
    <text>I forgot to pick up a few things from the trader. I'll run back and forth. Don't be fooled, Cluster won't let you go alone.</text>

    <text>Yep.</text>

    <text>What's the matter? Old man may grumble all the time, but he pays the money!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_1_idle_dialog_6">
    <text>He does, yes. But it's pennies, considering how hard it's earned! Have you seen what a mess is going on in the sawmill? There's anomalies all over the place!</text>

    <text>If you call yourself a stalker, go to the Zone. What's the problem?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_1_idle_dialog_8">
    <text>Yes, but the old man could pay me extra for working in particularly dangerous places! Well, that's all right! I hear Beard pays good money for artefacts. We'll spend a couple of weeks here with the boys, buy some gear, and head north!</text>

    <text>It's not an option to stay here and work for pennies either. I'm ready to take risks, to climb anomalies, to carry radioactive stuff, but only if they pay me accordingly. And you won't get decent pay from this old man.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_1_idle_dialog_11">

    <text>I don't really care what it costs or who it costs. I'm speaking for myself, the risks in these parts are unjustifiable. That's why we're not going to stay on Cordon. And neither should you.</text>
  </string>

    <text>All right.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_1_idle_dialog_15">
    <text>It's a deal.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_0">
    <text>Shit, damn, maybe through the roof...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_1">
    <text>What are you muttering about?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_2">
    <text>Oh, man, it's my turn to go to the sawmill!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_3">
    <text>What sawmill?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_4">
    <text>Into this damn anomal sawmill! It's creepy in there.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_5">
    <text>Everything will be fine! Take the bolts and throw them around. Watch it. If you hear the sound of the detector, move in the right direction.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_6">
    <text>Yeah, man, I'm getting dizzy from having anomalies around.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_7">
    <text>Do not be afraid! First time?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_8">
    <text>In fact, yes...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_9">
    <text>Then it's clear... If it makes you feel any better, look at me. I've taken out a dozen artefacts and I'm still alive. Hands, feet, I'm fine.  I remember the first time I went to get a art. I was so nervous. I must have thrown 300 bolts into the anomaly before I got to the artefact! If I felt that the danger was near — I stopped, breathed, and then I only got further. It's all about taking your time. But imagine what joy and pride you would feel afterwards because of the first artefact you found!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_10">
    <text>Why don't you use a fucking stick to kick that artefact out of there?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_11">
    <text>What stick, what are you talking about?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_12">
    <text>Oh, shit!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_13">
    <text>Stop. Go get it. You've got the guys next to you, they'll help you if you need it. The anomalies on Cordon aren't too strong yet, they won't kill you right away. Maybe...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_14">
    <text>You go tell that to that corpse over there by the sawmill, man!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_15">
    <text>Who's that?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_16">
    <text>I don't know. He was already there when we got here.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_17">
    <text>Have you examined him visually?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_18">
    <text>Not really... It's like a camp. Food, water, ammunition. He must have had a snack before he died. And then death caught up with him. </text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_19">
    <text>Right, so this was before the blowout, before there were any anomalies. Why else would he be picnicking in a place like this?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_20">
    <text>So what?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_21">
    <text>I don't think he died from the anomaly! There's fleshy creatures jumping around, they could have killed him! So, come on, go for it!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_22">
    <text>Damn, I'll just sit here for a bit and then I'll go!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_23">
    <text>Good luck to you!</text>

    <text>What's that old stuff you got on the radio?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_radio_dialog_1">
    <text>It's not old, kid! These are Soviet classics, songs of my youth! It used to be real music! And now. I don't even want to play it at all, it's just pop — no voice, no rhythm, just crap.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_ggwp_dialog_0">
    <text>What can you tell me that's interesting?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_ggwp_dialog_1">
    <text>If you go to the Garbage, be careful there. They say the bandits have lost their fear. You know the anomalous field behind the swamp? Forget it! They're there like they're fishing. And they're not fishing for artefacts! They don't want to go into the anomaly themselves, you see. They wait for some stalker to come and force him at gunpoint to get the artefact. Stinking ghouls! I'd like to beat them out of there, but who'd go?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_proso_dialog_0">
    <text>Hey, who are you?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_proso_dialog_1">
    <text>Oh, hello there! I'm Wolf. What's up? You've got some questions for me?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_proso_dialog_2">
    <text>Well, I just noticed you're sitting here all alone, cooking something. It's pretty unusual to see someone doing this outside a stalker camp.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_proso_dialog_3">
    <text>Right, but it's relatively safe here now. Besides, if anything happens — I always keep my gun by my side. Plus I can't really go back to the village right now. I haven't finished Sidorovich's job yet, so there's no point going back.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_proso_dialog_4">
    <text>So what are you cooking? It smells good!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_proso_dialog_5">
    <text>Pilaf. You want some? I'm letting the broth simmer for a bit, and then I'll pour in the rice. You can try it out in about an hour if you want!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_proso_dialog_6">
    <text>Thanks for the offer, I'll think about it. It's rare for see someone cook for themselves out here. It's all sausage and bread...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_proso_dialog_7">
    <text>I'm sick of eating that crap! Listen — you make yourself a whole cauldron of this stuff and it will last you for an entire week! But that's assuming you've got a Moonlight artefact on you. It's so cold that it serves as a great substitute for a refrigerator in the Zone. There's really no going without it in this summer heat — food rots way too quickly!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_proso_dialog_8">
    <text>What made you start cooking your own food?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_proso_dialog_9">
    <text>It all started with a prank assignment from this guy — his handle was Gordon Cook. You ever heard of him? He used to hang around the Garbage a lot. I haven't heard from him in a while. Who knows, maybe he's dead by now... But anyway, he gave me an assignment and promised to pay me handsomely; I had to go all the way to the Bar to buy all the necessary ingredients for pilaf. And because I was so green at the time, I didn't even realize he was joking. When I got to the Bar and asked, Barkeep looked at me like I was some idiot, but surprisingly the old man had all the necessary ingredients. When I got back to Gordon, he laughed, gave me some cash, and told me to keep the ingredients. I didn't think for much long and just cooked up some pilaf on the spot. The stalkers at the Depot ate it up. Since then, I've been making pilaf once every couple of months.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_proso_dialog_10">
    <text>You're one interesting man, that's for sure. Make sure the broth doesn't boil over! Good luck!</text>
