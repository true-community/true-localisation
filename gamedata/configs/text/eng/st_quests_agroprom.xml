    <text>My squad was at last trusted with a serious operation.

Yantar's always given me strange and sullen feelings — it's always felt damp, hopeless... and ridden with death, even while the mobile bunker was in operation and while stalkers flocked to sign up for work and go artifact hunting. But what about now? There have been all kinds of legends about the lake for a month now. Stalkers stay as far away from it as possible, the scientists haven't made contact with anyone and the anomalies have become increasingly active. What did Sakharov research? Are they still alive?
