  </string>
  <string id="gunsl_bizon_up_barrel_9x19_descr">
    <text>A total rework to accommodate the more powerful 9x19mm cartridge. Factory-original parts designed for the conversion process are used (just don't ask what channels they enter the Zone through, though). The end result is completely consistent with factory specifications and free of the drawbacks associated with homemade modifications. The magazine capacity after conversion is reduced to 53 rounds due to the longer length of the 9x19mm ammunition.</text>
