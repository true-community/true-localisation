  <string id="st_antirad_descr">
    <text>The radioprotective drug "Corryzeron-B53", widely distributed in the Zone. When applied, it causes narrowing of peripheral blood vessels and oxygen starvation, which in this case is a means of preventing and treating radiation sickness. Well tolerated by the vast majority of people; in some cases, slight nausea, dizziness, pain, less often vomiting are possible.</text>

  </string>
  <string id="st_detector1">
    <text>Echo detector</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_detector1_descr">
    <text>This dated anomalous activity detector produces an alarm signal when anomalous particles enter a special chamber as you approach an anomaly. It can also register the presence of artifacts and measure the distance to the nearest one. The distance is indicated by the frequency of the sound the detector emits. To switch to artifact search mode, open the device's front cover. Due to its simple design, Echo can only be used to locate the most common artifacts.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_detector2">
    <text>Detector "Bear"</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_detector2_descr">
    <text>This last generation anomalous activity detector can be used to locate anomalous formations and has a color diode panel, which not only indicates the direction of artifacts, but also measures the distance to them. To switch to artifact search mode, open the device's front cover. Unfortunately, the device is programmed with a somewhat outdated list of detectable artifacts.</text>

  <string id="st_detector3">
    <text>Veles detector</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_detector3_descr">
    <text>A detector scanner used by scientists.etection scanner. Thanks to three modernized detection chambers, the position of artifacts is shown on a special display screen. When closed, the device registers only radiation and anomalies. To switch to artifact search mode, open the front LED display. When in search mode, the detector is capable of locating all artifacts known to science.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_detector4">
    <text>Svarog detector</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_detector4_descr">
    <text>A new generation detector-scanner used by scientists. A programme has been added to recognise static zones of anomalous activity that exist in the database; at the same time, the possibility of detecting artefacts has been retained. The location of anomalous zones relative to the previous generation Veles detector is displayed on a special screen. The artefact search programme, which is activated by raising the indicator board on the front of the device, has been improved; theoretically, this makes it possible to detect anomalous formations not yet known to science.</text>

  <string id="st_drug_anabiotic_descr">
    <text>An experimental drug developed for research groups operating in the Zone. The tetradotoxin included in the formula of the drug, known as "zombie powder", causes complete paralysis of the central nervous system; presumably this could ensure survival out of cover during the ejection.
