    <text>What do you need?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_dialog_start_0">
    <text>Phew... I think we lost 'em. That was strange � our guy was meant to be on guard duty and they shouldn't have noticed us. Something didn't go as planned and someone else took over. I'll deal with it later; I can't lead around rookies like this.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_dialog_start_1">
    <text>It happens. Haven't been in the Zone for a while and I'm already wheezing from a little run!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_dialog_start_2">
    <text>Yeah. Shame we couldn't get through this time. This path is gonna be closed off for a while... Next time, we gotta make sure the right guy is keeping watch.</text>

    <text>Don't worry. We're alive, and that's a good sign.</text>

    <text>Sounds good!</text>

  <string id="esc_provodnik_camp_0">
    <text>So what made you want to return to the Zone?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_camp_1">
    <text>What can I say? After a couple of times here, I can't stop thinking about it. This is where I want to be.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_camp_2">
    <text>Everyone tells me the exact same thing: that you all have something in common... or, should I say, that *we* have something in common. I can't put my finger on what's keeping me here either. Truth be told, I try to stay within the Cordon, though the rookies here keep my pocket full � they need a guide almost every day. It's a shame many of them either disappear or die. Here's to it not happening any more!</text>

    <text>Cheers!</text>

    <text>Ah, that hit the spot! I myself went into the Zone with my buddy Vitka. At that time, my son died in a car crash... my bitch wife went binge-drinking... I'm an emotional man, so I got real worried. I met up with Vitka, we shared a bottle or two � just like you and I are now � and my tongue loosened up and I started telling him about my problems. At that point, nothing was keeping me home, so I took up his offer of heading into the Zone to unwind.\n \nWhile on the way there, he told me how he already had experience in the Zone. Shared a lot of interesting stuff with me, but with the state I was in at that time, I didn't pay much attention to it � I was looking to take my mind off things after what happened anyway. Then we went to the Cordon... Hey, don't forget to snack!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_camp_5">
    <text>Yeah, man, life sure hit you hard... Let's have another one...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_provodnik_camp_6">
    <text>It happens, right? Now, as for Vitka, he decided to head off beyond the Cordon. Poor bastard paid the price for it... Haven't heard from him in half a year, and all I get from asking the newcomers from the Garbage about him is a shrug. Some real shit started happening there... tons of bandit trash, anomalies all over the map... but despite of all of that, you don't understand what keeps you here in this goddamned Zone... Deep inside, maybe you're hoping to meet your friend who survived by some miracle?... I'll pour you another one...</text>

    <text>For the record, I did chop up a dog.</text>

  <string id="esc_trader_take_job_10">
    <text>Fooled me again, hah! Anyway, I've got a couple of assignments for you. My artifact hunter left to harvest his crop and disappeared somewhere. My thought is that either he found something valuable and ran off with it or the dogs there found something "valuable" and made him their lunch. Go there and have a look, will you? There's an anomaly in the tunnel under the bridge, which is precisely where he was going.</text>

    <text>Show me some results and we'll talk. You have all the equipment you need. Just don't let the soldiers catch you � I hear they raised the alarm last night and went looking for someone. Must be those good-for-nothing rookies! Can't even pass the checkpoint without being spotted.</text>

  </string>
  <string id="esc_kutek_dialog_2">
    <text>See, that's the thing: I wanted everyone to think I'm a goner. I'm tired of doing Sid's errands for free! I'm in debt to him... and it's a whole lot of money, let me tell you! Can't just walk away from it, and it'd take months before I work it all off, so I cooked up this little plan: found this poor bastard who ran into a bunch of dogs, dressed him in my clothing and left my PDA.</text>

    <text>You're really something! Why'd you come back, then?</text>

    <text>Great job. As for the artifact, I'll give you another five hundred on top and that's that. Real shame � he was a good collector. The guy did the work of three men whenever the need arose... What matters is that he was honest. Who will ever take his place, I wonder?...</text>

    <text>Now, now, Axe, don't get your shorts in a twist. I can't give you any more. At the end of the day, I gave you a good detector � how would you have found the artifacts without it? Find more after this and I'll buy it for a good price. By the way, Fanatic wanted to see you outside.

  <string id="esc_mechanic_repair_dialog_5">
    <text>Every night in the lowlands � that's where the radioactive swamp is � I've been seeing these strange hovering lights. It's gotta be artifacts, and very rare ones, too! I went there at daytime but didn't find anything. Seems like they only come out at night... and the night has its own dangers. I'm a technician, not a combatant, and there've been enough mutants around recently.\n \nIf you can check out that place and retrieve the artifacts, I'll fix your rifle and give you a discount on future orders. What do you say?</text>

  <string id="esc_mechanic_repair_dialog_6_1">

  <string id="fanat_logovo_dialog_7">
    <text>Okay, listen up. The four of us are planning to shoot down the pseudodogs � we're sick of them and their attacks on the village. Those things breed like rabbits! They usually hang out somewhere by the vehicle station, but we're not just going to put them down. We need to find their lair and blow it to kingdom come!</text>

  <string id="fanat_logovo_dialog_8">
    <text>What's the plan?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="fanat_logovo_dialog_9">
    <text>Wolf hid some dynamite near the locomotive. If you leave the village and follow the road to the railway bank, turn right and keep going until you see it. That's where you have to look. Find the dynamite and head to the place we've marked out. While we cover you, shoot down the dogs and place the dynamite by the hole, then we blow it up. Easier said than done, but we'll manage. Don't be long!</text>

  <string id="fanat_logovo_complete_0">
    <text>Phew! That was intense, but we did things quick! I hope this'll discourage those beasts from multiplying for a while. Here's some money and an AK, like I promised... though, it needs a repair. It's battered as it is, and if you try to fire it, it'll quite literally jam every shot.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="fanat_logovo_complete_1">
    <text>Where can I fix it? Is there anyone with the know-how?</text>

  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wound_dialog_4">
    <text>They tried starting the car before they figured out it was out of gas, then went back to their camp to get some. I'm pretty sure it's at the Garbage...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wound_dialog_5">
    <text>You got lucky there. The bullet went right through, but it looks like no vital parts were hit. I tried closing the wound, but you need to get back to the village before they return.</text>

    <text>I'll try getting back... You be careful too. Don't let 'em catch ya.</text>

  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wound_reversed_task_dialog_2">
    <text>Yeah, good question... They went to get gas after they realized the car's empty. They opened fire instantly and thought they got me... They'll be back in a second. We gotta hurry... Thanks for coming here, stalker. I won't forget it.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_car_wound_reversed_task_dialog_3">
    <text>Of course I'd help. How are you? Can you walk? Let me see. The bullet went right through � you're lucky. But you need to get back to the village either way.</text>

    <text>Nah, guys. Maybe later.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_most_leader_dialog_start_2">
    <text>Nothing out of the ordinary. We got back from an incursion not long ago. This place is good for relaxing and resting up.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_most_leader_dialog_start_3">
    <text>Your gear sure is neat... So where exactly are you returning from?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_most_leader_dialog_start_4">
    <text>You won't believe it anyway, but we were at the Chornobyl power plant. Radiation there was sky-high, so we had to no choice but to head back the way we came. Something is hiding behind that radiation, and we're thinking about how to slip through to find out. Might be artifacts... who knows.\n \nThere actually used to be five of us: I'm Brute, and the boys by the fire are Gravedigger and Guerilla. The other two were Warhorse and Mute... rest their souls. The former took a Monolith bullet back at the power plant, and he collapsed right in the middle of a psy-field we were running from. If not for that, he might've still been alive... The latter went missing two months ago. He told us he was heading to the army warehouses on a scouting trip, and we haven't seen him since. That's two months we haven't heard anything from him. My best bet is that he kicked the bucket... but while Warhorse had no chance, we can't say anything about Mute for sure.\n \nIf you find him or his remains, let me know. It's important to us.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_most_leader_dialog_start_5">
    <text>Of course! What a story, too. How is the CNPP? Anything interesting there?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_most_leader_dialog_start_6">
    <text>Nope! You'd best steer clear of that place, pal. Beats the hell out of me what's waiting for you there � we lost one friend, and we sure as hell aren't going back to that hellish place to lose another...\n \nOn the other hand, there are artifacts there as far as the eye can see. The biggest threats there are the Monolith and the psy-emissions, but there are a few places where you can bypass them both as long as you have the right equipment. It sure would be a dream to do that..\n \nHey, you ever heard about the Wish Granter? They say it's some kind of glowing rock that apparently fulfills your wishes. It's supposed to be located in the heart of the Zone: in the CNPP, under the Sarcophagus. On one hand, it's a bunch of crap, but on the other, what else could the Monolith guys be guarding? That means there's still a reason to check in there. Who might you be yourself, by the way?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_most_leader_dialog_start_7">
    <text>Ah, I go by "Axe." Nice to meet you. I also want to see the CNPP � must be full of artifacts despite the dangers! I've heard about that Wish Granter... Even though I don't really believe in it, I have the wish to be there! Alright, sorry for all the questions... it's just that hardened stalkers like you aren't around every corner. Thanks for the info. It was nice talking to you.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_most_leader_dialog_start_8">

    <text>Of course not. I'll earn some money and experience, and then I'll give my shot at traveling into the Zone. I'm just dreaming to see the CNPP with my own eyes... Just thinking about it takes my breath away!</text>

    <text>I mostly wander around the Cordon with my guys. We used to set up camp by the bridge and rest there, but now the military's back, so it's a bit harder these days.

  <string id="esc_shaiba_actor_story_dialog_5">
    <text>Hell, I don't even know what to tell you! A partner told me there's some weird stuff going on at the Duty outpost: some mystical entity appears before them at night. I don't believe in such stories, but when you hear such things from the horse's mouth, it's hard to even describe the feeling... All kinds of thoughts start storming you about what it could be.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_actor_story_dialog_6_1">
    <text>Probably just tall tales, but who knows. If I go there, I'll make sure to ask.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_actor_story_dialog_6_2">
    <text>They're not just stories. I was their at their outpost, and there's definitely some oddity there. The entity itself is harmless and appears when everyone's headed off at night.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_actor_story_dialog_7_1">
    <text>Up to you whether you believe it or not. I'm just telling you what I've heard.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_actor_story_dialog_7_2">
    <text>Well, now! I should stop going on excursions. The Cordon's got a balance to it: there's not much money, but you're not likely to die or lose your brains.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_actor_story_dialog_8_1">
    <text>I'll keep it in mind.</text>

    <text>Hey there! I heard you were planning to cross the embankment. Could you help me with something?</text>

    <text>What's it about?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_start_dialog_2">
    <text>A friend of mine, Kiryukha, went looking for loot on the other side and went missing. I don't know what might've happened to him... I hope he just found something useful and went to the Bar to make money off of it � he's like that. If you happen to find him on the way, let me know, 'kay?</text>

    <text>I can't promise you anything, but I'll tell you if I see him.</text>

    <text>I'm sorry, but your Kiryukha's dead...</text>

  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_3">
    <text>How? What happened?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_4">
    <text>Before his last breath, he told me he was tricked to the abandoned grain elevator by a talking flesh. I fell for it too, and barely dealt with it. Good thing there was only one... but behind the embankment, in the lowlands, there's a whole pack of them. See where I'm going?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_5">
    <text>What? What do you mean?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_6">
    <text>I mean that a number of our boys have fallen to those scum � there's a whole heap of bodies at the grain elevator. If we don't take them out, sooner or later, they'll head to the village. You get me? We need to tell Fanatic about this.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_7">
    <text>He's on a trip with a few stalkers. Said he'd be back in a couple of days.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_8">
    <text>So that means we'll do this without him. I imagine they'll be attacking the camp anytime now. Got any men who can help?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_9">
    <text>I think so, yeah. They all knew Kiryukha. They won't turn us down.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_10_1">
    <text>Alright. That means we're going. Kiryukha said he saw them by the embankment, though I don't know how many there are. Godspeed!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_shaiba_wait_dialog_10_2">
    <text>Alright. That means we'll go in the morning. Kiryukha said he saw them by the embankment, though I don't know how many there are. Godspeed!</text>

    <text>I'll take a moment to prepare, then we'll go.</text>

    <text>How about some other time?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_fanat_dialog_burnt_home_0">
    <text>I see there's one less house in the village. How did it get burned down? I spent a few nights in it last year, and now all that's left to hang around in is the dull basement.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_fanat_dialog_burnt_home_1">
    <text>Best you don't ask. A few guys and I had to leave for a couple of days while the rest stayed here. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and trusted them not to make any trouble... but I was wrong. Those bastards lit a campfire in front of the house, and by evening, they were all drunk and out of control. I don't know the details, but the house burned down by nighttime. Good thing the army didn't catch up � the smoke must've been invisible in the dark. You wouldn't believe the stench all over the village when I got back... I thought I'd die right then and there just from breathing it. Now there's no way I'm leaving for that long � who knows what these daredevils will come up with?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_fanat_dialog_burnt_home_2">
    <text>Well, that's one hell of a story. Is there really no one here to keep order besides you?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_village_fanat_dialog_burnt_home_3">
    <text>I wish... I look at those slinks and they all keep quiet. I ask, "Who burned down the house?" They say, "We all did it." Try giving them your trust after that.</text>

    <text>Hey there. I recently became the new owner of this little device, but it's in quite a sorry state. Could you take a look at it?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_start_1">
    <text>A 5.45 Groza? Now, *this* is a rare sample... Where did you get this thing? I've only ever seen it in enemy hands, and here you are bringing me one... a unique sample, too! Even if it's my first time with this gun, with a bottle, I'll make it do wonders in a couple days. Though, nothing in this world is free, you know?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_start_2">
    <text>How much?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_start_3">
    <text>No, money's not what I need right now. Got enough of it that I don't even know how to spend. Rather, I need a few work materials. I had a stalker that used to bring me those � Seryoga Koncheklyga � but he went missing about a week ago. According to him, you can get everything at the Garbage in some underground vault under the hangar. You've already seen those places, so take a look there and bring me everything you find.</text>

    <text>Do I have a choice?</text>
  </string>

    <text>What a coincidence � I've already been there. Looks like I wasn't carrying around this stuff for nothing. Will this do? Oh, and I found that stalker too. Dead... He's in the Electro in the woods.</text>

  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_start_5_1">
    <text>I don't think so. But if you don't really need the gun, I could buy it off you for three and a half. Don't look at me like that... This piece is trashed.</text>

  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_start_5_2_1">
    <text>Well, now! Just what I need. Okay, you can leave your piece here � I'll have it done in a day or two. I'll message you.</text>

    <text>Damn... Thanks for telling me. Here I was thinking he'd given up on my request. Now, about the stuff... Okay, this is just what I need! You can leave your piece here � I'll have it done in a day or two. I'll message you.</text>

  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_final_3_1">
    <text>Okay... just what I need. Here's your gun � you won't find anything like in the Zone, trust me. I even tried it out on some of the dogs, and it's a killing machine.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_final_3_2">
    <text>Damn! What happened, did he run into any of the mutants or roll around with a bullet in his head? Ugh, whatever... Here's your gun � you won't find anything like in the Zone, trust me. I even tried it out on some of the dogs, and it's a killing machine.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_technic_repair_groza_nimble_final_4">

    <text>What's it about?</text>

  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_start_dialog_8_1">
    <text>Go see Fanatic. He'll tell you.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_start_dialog_8_2">
    <text>Go see Fanatic. He'll tell you. Oh, almost forgot! Here's your pay for the soldier.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_start_dialog_9_1">
    <text>Okay.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_start_dialog_9_2">
    <text>Great, thanks! I'll go talk to Fanatic.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_0">
    <text>Hey there!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_1">
    <text>Yurok told me something happened.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_2">
    <text>That's right. We sighted a mercenary group not far from here. Heck knows what they're looking for, but they've been stationed there for two days now, and I don't like it. They even tried taking over our camp once, but it didn't work out for them... thanks to this one stalker who helped us.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_3">
    <text>Best we don't stir up the hornet's nest, huh? They're just standing around.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_4">
    <text>That's exactly the thing � they're not just standing around. Three stalkers from the village broke camp where they decided to position themselves. They were coming back from a trip with loot and decided to sit by the fire and have a meal. Then the mercs showed up and opened fire before we even opened our mouth. Only one of them got away, and he barely made it to the village with his wounds.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_5">
    <text>Did he survive?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_6">
    <text>Unfortunately, no. But the last thing he told me was that the mercs were dead serious about their business. The whole village is on alert � everyone's too afraid to leave. We need to do something. We don't know how long they're planning on staying here or what their plans are, and while they're here, we're not safe.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_7">
    <text>What do you suggest?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_8">
    <text>I suggest we use the element of surprise and attack them. There are only five of them. If we head up to their camp quietly, we could easily drop 'em. I have no one else to take with me on this mission � it's just me and Yurok. The other greenhorns won't go even if you hold a gun at them.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_9">
    <text>The three of us against a mercenary camp? Sounds dangerous.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_10">
    <text>If we bring the rookies, we're shooting ourselves in the foot. We have two advantages on our side: the element of surprise and a rocket launcher that some stalkers just stole from the army. We'll approach quietly and make blast those bastards. I have past experience with this � a group of mercenaries wanted to throw us out before, but we stood our ground.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_11">
    <text>You never change. Any problem comes up, you deal with it the explosive way.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_12">
    <text>The only way to do it! Are you with us?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_13">
    <text>Of course I'm with you. No way I'd leave you hanging. What's the plan?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_14">
    <text>We wait for sunrise and move out.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_start_dialog_15">
    <text>Understood.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_attack_ready_dialog_0">

    <text>I don't like this..</text>

  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_attack_relax_dialog_1">
    <text>Where'd they go?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_attack_relax_dialog_2">
    <text>No idea.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_attack_relax_dialog_3">
    <text>Maybe they're dug in below ground somewhere?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_attack_relax_dialog_4">
    <text>I don't see anything on the ground. What I did see was a bright flash.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_attack_relax_dialog_5">
    <text>What are we gonna do?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_attack_relax_dialog_6">
    <text>The only thing we can do: get back to camp. I don't know who these people are and where they disappeared, but I'm getting the creeps from this place. Let's just bury the guys along the way first instead of leaving them here.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_fanat_new_meet_attack_relax_dialog_7">
    <text>Let's go...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_second_dialog_0">
    <text>Well, that's how it goes. I hope they won't show up anymore. Still, Sidorovich needs to know of this � he'll think of something if his own skin is at stake.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_second_dialog_1">
    <text>If anything else comes up, let me know. I'll always help my old friends.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_second_dialog_2">
    <text>You stay in touch too! Thanks for the help. We owe you one. Where are you headed?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_second_dialog_3">
    <text>To Novoshepelychi. Got a job there. I actually came here to find out about a route leading to that place, and I had a free moment turn up just now. What can you tell me?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_jurok_new_meet_second_dialog_4">
    <text>It's an interesting place � I've been there a few times. The route to it is located near the mutant lair you and Fanatic blew up. Take a right turn and you'll end up at the collapsed railway tunnel, where you can go down and enter Novoshepelychi. Once you plan on coming back, don't bother going through the same route you came in � take the underground service tunnel instead. Once you're at the Cordon, go out through the door. For some reason, it's locked from the outside, which is why you have to take different paths. Now, be careful... The Garbage doesn't even compare in terms of danger.</text>
  </string>

    <text>Thanks. Good luck to you here. I'll meet up with you soon!</text>

    <text>We're good guys when listened to and when we're understood the first time. So we'll do it like this: you tell us the place you hid the goods, we grab it, and you continue your own path. What was it you were doing again? Shooting mutants? Gathering artifacts? That's exactly what you'll keep doing, like nothing happened.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_mid_final_mercs_merc_leader_start_dialog_5">

    <text>I found the body of a stalker at the Garbage. His name was Mishgan. Here's a note he had on him. He asked me to take his PDA to the rookie village.</text>

    <text>Shit... Mishgan! I told him to stay out of that damn Garbage! How'd it happen?</text>

    <text>He needed help freeing his comrades from bandits. Our odds weren't great, so I turned him down. Mishgan whacked me in the head and went off on his own... When I woke up, I found three bodies at the vehicle graveyard: it was him and two of his friends. The bandits were gone by then.</text>

  <string id="esc_trader_second_job_dialog_start_1_2">
    <text>Hello there. Something's been coming up: the army and scientists were supposed to carry out some field research here at the Cordon. I wanted to ask you to see where they go, but they were having some problems at the checkpoints... a shootout of some kind. So right now I can only offer you small-time work.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_second_job_dialog_start_2">
    <text>I'm all ears.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_second_job_dialog_start_3_1">
    <text>There's a scientist team that's soon arriving at the military checkpoint. I don't know what the hell they're after, but I do know that they're about to depart with a military escort to do some field research.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_second_job_dialog_start_3_2">
    <text>This one stalker, Puck, sent me a message not long ago. Not far away from here, by the Electro tunnel, there's a lot of mutant scum that needs cleaning out. Will you do it?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_second_job_dialog_start_4_1">
    <text>What field research?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_second_job_dialog_start_4_2_1">
    <text>Of course. Need to earn cash somehow. I'm not planning on staying at the Cordon.</text>

  <string id="esc_trader_second_job_dialog_start_4_2_2">
    <text>There's nothing there. I literally just cleaned the place out.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_second_job_dialog_start_5_1">
    <text>That's what I want to find out. Maybe they're cooking something up against the stalkers, and that means my business will take a hit. I need to know everything. You'll be tracking them, but be careful about it. See where they go and what they'll be doing, then report to me. Now, get moving! We'll settle up later.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_second_job_dialog_start_5_2_1">
    <text>Then get to work. Make sure you clean out every single beast.</text>

    <text>Great work, then. Here's your reward. You're free to go � I have nothing more to offer you.</text>

    <text>Got it. I'll do the best I can.</text>

    <text>Sid, things have happened... Basically, all field research was canceled, and I barely made it away from the army alive.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_scientists_jobs_cancel_dialog_1">
    <text>What do you mean, canceled? That's good on the one hand... but on the other, your parents must be ashamed of you. Soon enough, they might come back and carry out their experiments, and you, of course, won't be at the Cordon by then. I'll have to find someone else.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_scientists_jobs_cancel_dialog_2">
    <text>Well, what can you do...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_scientists_jobs_cancel_dialog_3">

    <text>Goodbye, Sid.</text>

    <text>Sid, the eggheads spotted me. I barely made it out alive. That field research will definitely be delayed for some time.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_scientists_fail_dialog_1">
    <text>If anyone finds out, you'll have some serious problems on your hands with your reputation. Don't expect me to trust you with anything more serious from now on.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_scientists_fail_dialog_2">
    <text>Just don't tell anyone about it, Sid. Let's say I dealt with any problems in advance that they would've caused it. C'mon, gimme a reward!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_scientists_fail_dialog_3">
    <text>You're quite bold, aren't you, stalker? A reward's not what you need... no, you need a good smack on the head. Now, get out.</text>

    <text>Bye, Sid...</text>

    <text>Talked to the prisoners? Does the clothing suit you alright?</text>

    <text>I haven't found out anything new, unfortunately. I'll go see Sidorovich.</text>

    <text>The clothing fits, thank you. As for the prisoners, I haven't found out anything new, so I'll go see Sidorovich.</text>

  <string id="esc_army_base_soldier_leader_clothes_second_dialog_2">
    <text>Just keep your ID with you so you don't get taken by our boys.</text>

  <string id="esc_army_base_soldier_leader_clothes_second_dialog_3">
    <text>Of course. What will we do about the detainees?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_army_base_soldier_leader_clothes_second_dialog_4">
    <text>What do you think? As per all laws of mother Ukraine, they'll end up in court... Actually, no! First they'll do some work for the benefit of our checkpoint � we need a fresh coat of paint for the garage and new plastering for the workshop. After that, we can have those boys deported. What, does your facility also need extra manpower?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_army_base_soldier_leader_clothes_second_dialog_5">
    <text>We need brains, not muscle. I might need this one stalker named Shimmer soon. Don't do anything rash to him.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_army_base_soldier_leader_clothes_second_dialog_6">
    <text>Noted. If he doesn't get high on paint, it'll be alright. But remember: you have two days. After that, they'll be escorted to the outside.</text>

  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_3">
    <text>What else is there to do here? These areas are mapped out down to the last inch. The north, on the other hand... that's where I want to go.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_4_1">
    <text>Judging by your wear, your "north" goes as far as the pig farm by the bridge. Hah!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_4_2">
    <text>Still, I don't know anything about you. To tell you the truth, I wouldn't want to, either.</text>

    <text>Alright. What do you need?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_search_first_actor_dialog_7">
    <text>I need information on a stalker. I take it that's the most valuable currency here, so I have something to offer in return.</text>

    <text>Yeah? And what might that be?</text>

    <text>Does information on Yantar interest you?</text>
  </string>

    <text>Not at all! I've sent three teams there, and not a single one has come back alive!</text>

    <text>If I offer you a detailed map of the vicinity, the chance of your next team returning will be higher... and there might be profit in it for you personally. Interested?</text>

    <text>Of course I have.</text>

  <string id="esc_trader_composer_task_start_dialog_1">
    <text>There is. It's not your first day in the Zone, so you can handle it. Some of the boys at the Garbage need help with dealing with dogs and digging out some minor artifacts. All you have to do is cover their backs and they'll give you your cut when it's done.</text>
  </string>

    <text>Got it. Give me the coordinates.</text>

    <text>So bad they exiled you?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_4">

    <text>Tell me what happened.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_6">
    <text>You don't know? I scared the shit out of everyone! One night, the boys were drinking and I decided to play a prank on them when they were spread around their camps. You probably the same thing back in pioneer camp, eh? I shouted across the whole village: "Pseudodogs! Pseudodogs are attacking!" Everyone went full alert and took up positions. I couldn't keep myself from laughing like an idiot. I told them it was just a joke. After that, they gave me such a beating I couldn't even say a word in the morning. Now, nobody even wants to talk to me. My new name? "Jester." I'm the only one who laughed at my own prank... and they no longer believe a word I say.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_7_1">
    <text>What do you have to say about it?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_7_2">
    <text>That's what you get. Do you even know where we are, you idiot? This is no place for jokes, and your prank was worse than any real pseudodog out there!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_8_1">
    <text>Whatever I say, nobody will care. Though... I did notice something through my binoculars when I was on a task from Sidorovich by the embankment.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_8_2">
    <text>I know... but nobody believes me anymore! Though, right after that, I noticed something through my binoculars when I was on a task from Sidorovich by the embankment.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_9">
    <text>What exactly?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_10">
    <text>An artifact. I haven't seen its kind before, and whoever I asked said they didn't know anything. I'm too afraid to go by myself, though... It's right by the pig farm, and as you know, that place is full of flesh. Nobody wants to go with me, and the elder just laughs it off when I tell him about it.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_11_1">
    <text>You want me to come?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_11_2">

  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_start_dialog_13_1">
    <text>Sure. Let's go find your artifact.</text>
  </string>

    <text>Show the way.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_take_dialog_0">
    <text>Oh, that's rich... There really was a pack of pseudodogs here. Should've kept my mouth shut from the start! Let me at least look at the artifact.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_take_dialog_1_1">
    <text>Here, you earned it.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_take_dialog_1_2">
    <text>I'll take it for myself.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_take_dialog_2_1">
    <text>An interesting piece, for sure. I'm wondering about it's properties... I guess we should talk to Sidorovich about that. We heading back to camp?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_take_dialog_2_2">
    <text>Hey, that wasn't the deal! Have a heart and give it to me!</text>
  </string>

    <text>Yeah, let's go.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_take_dialog_3_2">
    <text>Piss off. The artifact is mine, and that's that.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_end_dialog_0">
    <text>Home, sweet home. I'll head into the camp to grab a few of my things and rest, then go to Sidorovich and sell them along with the artifact. Don't go too far � I'll contact you when I have a deal with him. You've earned half of the sum.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_end_dialog_1">
    <text>As you say. Just don't think about fooling me.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_end_dialog_2">
    <text>Why'd I do that? You're the first one to believe me after such a long time!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_end_dialog_3">
    <text>My advice to you, Jester, is to treat the other rookies to a drink and apologize to them.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_end_dialog_4">
    <text>Yeah, you're right. I'll treat them to something and apologize. Maybe they'll believe me after I tell them.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_artefact_end_dialog_5">
    <text>Good. Talk to you soon.</text>
  </string>

    <text>Thanks, Jester... if they still call you that.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_stalker_liar_reward_dialog_2">
    <text>Don't worry 'bout it. It kind of stuck to me. Still, things are all good between me and the rest, as you can see. Wanna stay with us, maybe share a few tales?</text>

    <text>Sorry, but it's time for me. Good luck, stalker... I hope you've learned your lesson.</text>

  <string id="esc_composer_task_bandit_savior_army_base_dialog_2">
    <text>Yes, I do. My name is Alexey Kucherenko and it so happens that I work undercover in the Zone, infiltrating different groups, finding out all kinds of information about everything that happens in the Zone. I know... quite a bit. That's all I can say about myself. You know what I mean!</text>

    <text>I already know who you are. No, I'm not a military, but I co-operate with them on various issues as well. Let's just say that some people in the Zone know who I am other than the real Cluster kid, these people are few, but they are very useful people.</text>

  <string id="esc_composer_task_bandit_savior_army_base_dialog_6">
    <text>Well, I do know some things, but I can't tell you much. And believe me, you live longer with less. Information... it can hurt...</text>

  <string id="esc_composer_task_bandit_savior_army_base_dialog_7">
    <text>All right, well, tell me something so it's not so vague, and where's Birdie?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_bandit_savior_army_base_dialog_8">
    <text>About Birdie. Hmm. Well, I don't trust him all that much. As for the whole cargo thing, it's simple. There were two, maybe not brilliant, but quite clever scientists working on a psy emitter in the Zone. We've already talked to both of them in one way or another. But, as usual, one has goals, so to speak, for the good of mankind, and the other has... a more scientific interest. I'm doing my job, and as long as it matches your goals, we're partners.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_bandit_savior_army_base_dialog_9">
    <text>Let me guess, when the goals don't align, you're gonna killed me?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_bandit_savior_army_base_dialog_10">
    <text>What?! The military stuff doesn't apply to me. I meant we'll go our separate ways. And yes, let Birdie keep thinking Cluster is a real kid from the big road. </text>

  <string id="esc_composer_task_bandit_savior_army_base_dialog_11">
    <text>By the way, why a bandit?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_bandit_savior_army_base_dialog_12">
    <text>That's because so few people take it seriously. It's good to be underestimated! So, today I'm Cluster the bandit, and tomorrow someone else. Don't worry your head. Go to Smyshlov's, I'll come later, they haven't agreed with Birdie yet.</text>

    <text>Well, hello, stalker. Glad to see you're alive and well! Where's the device?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_1">
    <text>I'm sick of you people asking the same question... at least now you have an answer. Turov has it. Understand? He set his people on us. And they took it away.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_2">
    <text>What?!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_3">
    <text>I've had a lot of people die because of this thing, and I almost met the same fate as them a few times. What am I to you, some delivery boy? Jesus, one's asking for some device, the other's asking for a bunch of papers... At least thanks for not pointing a gun at the back of my head! You're supposed to be men of science � the light of truth and all that, but you're like little children, you can't come to an agreement! What do you want?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_4">
    <text>I can see you want answers... Alright then, let's start in order. When I was in my third year, I met Turov and...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_5">
    <text>Professor, I don't want a retelling of your memoirs, I'm not a book publisher!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_6_1">
    <text>Okay, okay, I'll try to keep it short. Some time ago, me and my ex-colleague Turov planned to put our scientific concepts and hypnoses into practice. The Exclusion Zone was just what we were looking for � a treasure trove of all kinds of subjects, with which we could get proper recognition from our colleagues and maybe even earn a Nobel Prize for studying the properties of the Zone's nature, as well as its anomalies, flora and fauna! But most of all we were interested in the what we call "psy-radiation", the nature of which still remains a complete mystery for us to this day. At the time, I thought we were planning on building a portable psy-emitter for therapeutic purposes. We wanted to cure those unfortunates whose brains had stopped functioning properly after exposure to psy-radiation. After a long design process, we had finally built a mobile prototype psy-emitter.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_6_2">
    <text>Go on.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_6_3">
    <text>Its task was not only to protect us from the Zone's psy-radiation, but like I said, to also have a therapeutic effect on zombified individuals. We had also planned to adapt our psy-emitter for medical purposes outside the Exclusion Zone. The prototype we made could not only generate psy-radiation, but also change its nature and adjust the power of flow. Unfortunately, the more time went on, the more Turov started disagreeing with me on so many aspects of the project, and on how to apply the prototype. His interest was less humanitarian. Most of all, Turov was trying to find out how to use the transmitter to control the consciousness of not only animals and mutants, but also humans. After that, I stopped cooperating with him for good.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_7">
    <text>So your psy-device can be good or bad? It's just a matter of who uses it?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_8">
    <text>Luckly, or unluckly � yes, that's exactly how it is. You just can't divide the world into good and bad! That's not how it works!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_9">
    <text>I see. But you're one of them, aren't you? Why can't you both strike some sort of deal?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_10">
    <text>Do I have to?... Let me guess: Turov told you about the incident I had during the tests and that I'm really paranoid now? And then, probably, he told you that because of my paranoia I suspected a decent scientist, who stands for science and enlightenment and absolutely nothing more � of using a psy-emitter for manipulation and for his own selfish purposes? Oh, and that he sending you to get my documents so that he could finally have a chance to cure me, right?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_11">
    <text>Well... give or take, yeah.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_12">
    <text>You see, I was indeed hit by the radiation, but it had no negative effect on me. Quite the opposite. I'm as calm as I've ever been. And it was a two-way mental link. But still I had an obsessive thought about Turov not after the radiation, but when he began to spend more time on experiments on controlling the consciousness of living and non-living beings. Time goes by, and those who were exposed to the Brain Scorcher radiation are not getting younger either, and I think that they should be helped first of all. Turov, of course, explained his actions as creating a special stream of radiation to protect against monster attacks, so that the scientists could safely move around the Zone. Think about what I said!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_13">
    <text>Isn't it bad for every person in the Zone to have a device?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_14">
    <text>Of course it's good! Do you know what the dynamite was originally created for? That's just it, inventions can always be used for good purposes or vice versa, whether directly or indirectly. History knows many such examples. And our psy device will affect both monsters and humans, that's the problem! What happens if you are forced to go to the most dangerous places of the Zone against your will? Is it a good thing when you or any other person can be controlled with buttons and toggle switches? Do you want to be a puppet of an unknown puppeteer?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_15">
    <text>Are you guys out of your minds? Why are you doing this kind of development? You want to be a god?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_16">
    <text>You have no idea how much can be achieved! For me, this development was worth a lot, too much!</text>

    <text>Professor, listen to yourself! Turov has your device, the whole thing! I just don't understand why he needs your documents.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_20">
    <text>It's simple, the device is unstable even at short distances. And in order for it to work stably at a distance of several kilometres and not to lose power every five minutes, the core must be reinforced. And only I know how to do it.</text>

  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_start_dialog_22">
    <text>I understand. But you can't undo what you've done, and now you have to deal with the consequences. So give me some time to think this through. In the meantime, go to Sidorovich and get some psy-blockers. Tell him I sent you.</text>

    <text>Thank you. I'm about to be hunted down by Turov's mate. So now would be a good time to tell me your plan.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_1">
    <text>I've given it a lot of thought. I won't give him the documents.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_2">
    <text>Professor, you know my situation. So if you don't give me the documents, I'll have to take them from you by force!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_3">
    <text>It won't be necessary. I'll go with you to see Turov.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_4">
    <text>We-e-ll... what are you up to?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_5">
    <text>Talking to an old colleague and friend. I want to talk some sense into him...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_6">
    <text>Professor, there must be something you're not telling me. You know that Turov can talk you out of this either with a gun or with your mobile emitter! Tell me directly what you want to do.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_7">
    <text>It's very simple, look at this. The core isn't just a screw, it's the brain of a living being that's been subjected to psi-influence. Or rather, a creature that died from a psy effect. So, depending on who the creature was when it was alive, the device operates on a certain spectrum of psy radiation. And that affects not only the strength and range of the effects, but also the...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_8">
    <text>Professor, we're stalkers, we're not scientists, we don't understand you!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_9">
    <text>Then why did you ask?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_10">
    <text>I was asking for your plan of action, not how your piece of metal works...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_11">
    <text>It's not a piece of metal! It's almost a living being, capable of releasing, amplifying and channelling its psy-energy to the right organisms with the help of the device!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_12">
    <text>Um... What do you have, a pocket Controller in there?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_13">
    <text>Well, if you want to simplify it, so be it, but it's not a Controller. The point is that this creature is empathically aware of what's going on around it, but it's not fully trained, it doesn't understand what's "good" and what's "bad"!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_14">
    <text>So that's it... So this pocket one of yours, what's his name, is lying in a a glass cartridge and while the power is not connected, it sleeps, right? And when it's powered up, it stays awake and kills everyone around it? Like those stalker and mercenaries?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_15">
    <text>Yes and no! A group of stalkers carrying a container were attacked by mutants. People were experiencing fear, pain, shock, and other negative emotions. Now, the creature in the container understands all of these emotions and experiences them. This range of emotions traumatises it. So in order to protect itself, it took control of part of the group of stalkers and eliminated them.... and the rest ran away with the container, believing that the controller was nearby!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_16">
    <text>What a poetic ending... Killed by a mini-mutant in a container while defending from mutants...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_17">
    <text>No, I mean yes, but no!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_18">
    <text>Okay. Let's summarise. One of the three boxes contains a brain that can do things with psy radiation. I take it that's the core, right? And if that's the case, what can you change about it, this brain?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_second_dialog_19">
    <text>You asked for no details! Give me the radio, I'll talk to Turov.</text>

    <text>Now let's go visit! I'll just grab a few things. And yes, we're leaving a few minutes apart. I'll go first, then you come out after me.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_final_dialog_3">
    <text>Come on, old man, come on. You'll never make it alone. All you know how to do is sit in your concrete boxes and poke at microscopes with tweezers! Do you even have a detector and a dosimeter?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_final_dialog_4">
    <text>I don't need detectors after the radiation I've received. I can feel them, the traps of the Zone. But I'll bring my machine gun.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_final_dialog_5">
    <text>I wouldn't mind some of that exposure too, cool! Anyway, old man, wait. We're not letting you go alone!</text>

  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_final_dialog_6">
    <text>Why is that?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_final_dialog_7">
    <text>What if you decide to run away and we have to deal with Turov and Vizir. And I think they'll give us such lead pills that we'll be in trouble.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_composer_task_scientist_final_dialog_8">
    <text>Don't worry, I'm a decent person and I keep my word!</text>

    <text>All right.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_1_idle_dialog_15">
    <text>It's a deal.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_0">
    <text>Shit, damn, maybe through the roof...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_1">
    <text>What are you muttering about?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_2">
    <text>Oh, man, it's my turn to go to the sawmill!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_3">
    <text>What sawmill?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_4">
    <text>Into this damn anomal sawmill! It's creepy in there.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_5">
    <text>Everything will be fine! Take the bolts and throw them around. Watch it. If you hear the sound of the detector, move in the right direction.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_6">
    <text>Yeah, man, I'm getting dizzy from having anomalies around.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_7">
    <text>Do not be afraid! First time?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_8">
    <text>In fact, yes...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_9">
    <text>Then it's clear... If it makes you feel any better, look at me. I've taken out a dozen artefacts and I'm still alive. Hands, feet, I'm fine.  I remember the first time I went to get a art. I was so nervous. I must have thrown 300 bolts into the anomaly before I got to the artefact! If I felt that the danger was near � I stopped, breathed, and then I only got further. It's all about taking your time. But imagine what joy and pride you would feel afterwards because of the first artefact you found!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_10">
    <text>Why don't you use a fucking stick to kick that artefact out of there?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_11">
    <text>What stick, what are you talking about?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_12">
    <text>Oh, shit!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_13">
    <text>Stop. Go get it. You've got the guys next to you, they'll help you if you need it. The anomalies on Cordon aren't too strong yet, they won't kill you right away. Maybe...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_14">
    <text>You go tell that to that corpse over there by the sawmill, man!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_15">
    <text>Who's that?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_16">
    <text>I don't know. He was already there when we got here.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_17">
    <text>Have you examined him visually?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_18">
    <text>Not really... It's like a camp. Food, water, ammunition. He must have had a snack before he died. And then death caught up with him. </text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_19">
    <text>Right, so this was before the blowout, before there were any anomalies. Why else would he be picnicking in a place like this?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_20">
    <text>So what?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_21">
    <text>I don't think he died from the anomaly! There's fleshy creatures jumping around, they could have killed him! So, come on, go for it!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_forestry_stalker_2_idle_dialog_22">
    <text>Damn, I'll just sit here for a bit and then I'll go!</text>

    <text>Good luck to you!</text>

    <text>What's that old stuff you got on the radio?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_radio_dialog_1">
    <text>It's not old, kid! These are Soviet classics, songs of my youth! It used to be real music! And now. I don't even want to play it at all, it's just pop � no voice, no rhythm, just crap.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_ggwp_dialog_0">
    <text>What can you tell me that's interesting?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_trader_ggwp_dialog_1">
    <text>If you go to the Garbage, be careful there. They say the bandits have lost their fear. You know the anomalous field behind the swamp? Forget it! They're there like they're fishing. And they're not fishing for artefacts! They don't want to go into the anomaly themselves, you see. They wait for some stalker to come and force him at gunpoint to get the artefact. Stinking ghouls! I'd like to beat them out of there, but who'd go?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_proso_dialog_0">
    <text>Hey, who are you?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_proso_dialog_1">
    <text>Oh, hello there! I'm Wolf. What's up? You've got some questions for me?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_proso_dialog_2">
    <text>Well, I just noticed you're sitting here all alone, cooking something. It's pretty unusual to see someone doing this outside a stalker camp.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_proso_dialog_3">
    <text>Right, but it's relatively safe here now. Besides, if anything happens � I always keep my gun by my side. Plus I can't really go back to the village right now. I haven't finished Sidorovich's job yet, so there's no point going back.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_proso_dialog_4">
    <text>So what are you cooking? It smells good!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_proso_dialog_5">
    <text>Pilaf. You want some? I'm letting the broth simmer for a bit, and then I'll pour in the rice. You can try it out in about an hour if you want!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_proso_dialog_6">
    <text>Thanks for the offer, I'll think about it. It's rare for see someone cook for themselves out here. It's all sausage and bread...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_proso_dialog_7">
    <text>I'm sick of eating that crap! Listen � you make yourself a whole cauldron of this stuff and it will last you for an entire week! But that's assuming you've got a Moonlight artefact on you. It's so cold that it serves as a great substitute for a refrigerator in the Zone. There's really no going without it in this summer heat � food rots way too quickly!</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_proso_dialog_8">
    <text>What made you start cooking your own food?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_proso_dialog_9">
    <text>It all started with a prank assignment from this guy � his handle was Gordon Cook. You ever heard of him? He used to hang around the Garbage a lot. I haven't heard from him in a while. Who knows, maybe he's dead by now... But anyway, he gave me an assignment and promised to pay me handsomely; I had to go all the way to the Bar to buy all the necessary ingredients for pilaf. And because I was so green at the time, I didn't even realize he was joking. When I got to the Bar and asked, Barkeep looked at me like I was some idiot, but surprisingly the old man had all the necessary ingredients. When I got back to Gordon, he laughed, gave me some cash, and told me to keep the ingredients. I didn't think for much long and just cooked up some pilaf on the spot. The stalkers at the Depot ate it up. Since then, I've been making pilaf once every couple of months.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="esc_proso_dialog_10">
    <text>You're one interesting man, that's for sure. Make sure the broth doesn't boil over! Good luck!</text>
